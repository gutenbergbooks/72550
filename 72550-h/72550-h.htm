<p>“I never knew such an unmitigated young
idiot!” exclaimed Sir Reginald the next
morning at breakfast, as he tossed aside
a letter and tore open a paper with a rustle
of impatience.</p>

<p>“You are not alluding to any of the
present company, I trust?” asked Geoffrey
mildly, as he helped himself lavishly to
marmalade.</p>

<p>“No,” returned his cousin, without raising
his eyes from the perusal of some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
interesting piece of military news, “no,
only one of our fellows at the depôt.”</p>

<p>“Go on, I’m thirsting for particulars.
What has he been doing? Getting
married?”</p>

<p>“Setting up a racing-stable,” replied
Sir Reginald, laying down the paper; “and
he knows as much about the turf as—as—”
looking round for a simile—“Maurice. He
has a horse in for these Sundown Races,
on Friday; a new purchase, called”—referring
to the note—“Tornado, and has
backed him heavily, of course.”</p>

<p>“Tornado,” echoed Geoffrey; “I know the
brute well—a pulling, tearing, mad chestnut.
He won the Chester Cup when
Langstaffe had him. But he is a real
devil to ride. He killed one jockey—bolted
into a stable with him—and Langstaffe has
had to pay up well for the support of his
widow and children. I congratulate your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
young friend. Is he going to ride him
himself?”</p>

<p>“No. As far as equestrian feats are
concerned, he considers discretion to be
the mother of all virtues; he will put up
a professional of course.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope he may be able to hold
him, and keep him within the flags, that’s
all,” returned Geoffrey, with a doubtful
shake of the head; “he can gallop and
stay like a good ’un, if he chooses, but I’ll
take odds he bolts.”</p>

<p>“I find I have to go to town this morning,”
said Sir Reginald, addressing himself
to the whole circle. “Barker wants me
to meet him to-day about some old leases;
very probably I shall not come back till
to-morrow night.”</p>

<p>“Then, my dear Regy, you will bring me
down my watch from Benson’s,” cried Helen
eagerly. “And I want some arosane and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
crewel wools; a few dark green and yellow
shades to finish——”</p>

<p>“No; there I draw the line,” he interrupted
with a laugh; “anything but fancy
work! Imagine my going into a wool
shop, and being discovered by some of my
lady friends! I dare not trust myself to
answer for the consequences.”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget to go to the Army and
Navy Stores and order some new tennis
bats,” observed Alice, without raising her
eyes from an engrossing letter.</p>

<p>“And bring me a couple of boxes
of cigarettes, as per usual,” put in
Geoffrey.</p>

<p>“Yes; anything else?” replied Sir Reginald,
entering these items rapidly in his
note-book.</p>

<p>“You might bring down another box of
books from Mudie’s,” added Helen suavely;
“I’ll just make out a list,” rising and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
pushing back her chair and hastening into
the next room.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t be long, Helen, as I am
going off immediately. You may as well
drive over to Manister and leave me at
the station, Geoffrey. It will help you to
kill your arch-enemy, Time. The trap will
be round in ten minutes.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The next day Sir Reginald, having
transacted his business and all the commissions,
was strolling down Pall Mall,
when he was suddenly brought to a
standstill by a vigorous slap on the
back, and, turning round, he found himself
confronting Captain Vaughan and
Captain Campell.</p>

<p>“The very man I want!” exclaimed the
latter eagerly.</p>

<p>“How fit you look, old fellow!” cried
Captain Vaughan, devouring his late<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
patient with his eyes and wringing his
hand in an agonising grasp.</p>

<p>“When did you come to town? Where
are you staying? Come on to the Club
and tell us all about yourself,” they chimed
alternately.</p>

<p>During luncheon, Mr. Campell ejaculated:
“Talk of coincidences! Do you know that,
five minutes before we overtook you,
Fairfax, I had just sent you a telegram,
and, as we turned into Pall Mall, you
were almost the first man we saw! Odd,
wasn’t it? ‘That’s Fairfax, I bet you a
fiver,’ said Vaughan; ‘I could swear to his
walk—subdued cavalry swagger.’ And
sure enough he was right for once. I’m
in a most awful hat this time, and no
mistake; and you are the only fellow
who can pull me through,” he added,
leaning both elbows on the table and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
looking at his friend with an air of grave
conviction.</p>

<p>“I?” echoed Sir Reginald. “How?
What do you mean? I haven’t the
faintest glimmering idea of what you are
driving at.”</p>

<p>“You know I have a horse in for the
Sundown Races?”</p>

<p>A nod was his reply.</p>

<p>“At the last moment—the eleventh
hour—my jockey has thrown me over—last
night actually—and the race comes
off to-morrow. Where am I to get another
unless you’ll ride for me?”—imploringly.
“If you don’t,” he resumed, “I shall
be smashed—horse, foot, and dragoons.
Already the horse has fallen tremendously
in the betting; but I won’t hedge a farthing,”
with a resolute thump of his fist;
“I mean to be a man or a mouse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>“But why pitch on Fairfax like this?”
said Captain Vaughan irritably. “I told
you, when you were sending the telegram,
how uncommonly cool I thought you.
One would think he was gentleman-rider
to the regiment. How you have the
cheek to ask him to ride such a brute,
considering his broken arm and his only
just coming off the sick-list, is more than
I can understand,” puffing resentfully at
his cigar.</p>

<p>“Oh, Fairfax can manage anything.
Tornado is not half as bad as that devil of
Wyndham’s he rode at Poonah. Riding is
child’s play to him.” Turning to Sir
Reginald: “You will ride for me, won’t
you?” he asked confidently. “If I don’t
win this race it will be all U P. I
shall have to send in my papers and
volunteer as a trooper in one of those Cape
regiments.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>“Come, I hope you are not so bad as
all that. I must see what I can do; but
I’m not by any means the wonderful
jockey you imagine.”</p>

<p>“You will ride him, you will! I knew
it. You were always a brick!” cried
Captain Campell ecstatically, jumping up
with such energy as to overset his chair
with a loud crash.</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake, sit down and compose
yourself,” exclaimed Captain Vaughan
angrily, “unless you want the people to
think you are a subject for personal
restraint. Fairfax,” turning to his brother-officer
with solemnity, “does your wife
allow you to ride races?”</p>

<p>“My wife”—reddening—“allows me to
do whatever I please.”</p>

<p>“What a matrimonial rara avis!”
muttered Captain Vaughan under his
breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“You will ride for me, Fairfax; I
depend on you,” said Captain Campell.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll ride for you, though you
have given me awfully short notice;
but, remember, I don’t guarantee that
I’ll win.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no fear of that if you can only
hold him,” frankly returned his brother-officer,
leaning across the table and volubly
expatiating on the horse’s merits—age,
pedigree, and performances—and giving a
long and confidential <i>résumé</i> of his temper
and traits. “His groom, who knows him
well, will give you a wrinkle or two
before the race comes off to-morrow. He
and the horse started yesterday, and we,”
indicating Captain Vaughan and himself,
“run down to-night. You can’t think
what a load you have taken off my mind,”
he added, heaving a deep sigh.</p>

<p>“Have you telegraphed for rooms at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
hotel?” inquired Captain Vaughan, always
practical.</p>

<p>“No, by Jove!—I never thought
about it.”</p>

<p>Little as Sir Reginald was prepared to
expose his domestic concerns to public
criticism, he felt that it behoved him to
extend some hospitality to his two brother-officers—one
of them his particular friend,
so he exclaimed, with well-feigned
cordiality:</p>

<p>“Sundown is in our part of the world—only
eight miles from our place. Of
course you will both come to Monkswood,
and I can drive you over to the races
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, my dear fellow, we shall be
delighted,” returned Mr. Campell warmly,
“if it won’t be putting you out—nor Lady
Fairfax?”</p>

<p>“Lady Fairfax will be very glad to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
you. I am going down by the 4.30, and
we might travel together. It is now,”
pulling out his watch, “five minutes past
three; I must go and get my traps.
Whatever you do, don’t be late, Vaughan;
I leave you to take charge of Campell,
who never was in time in his life—not even
for an Indian train.”</p>

<p>The two hussars were not a little curious
to see Fairfax as a family man. What was
his home like? his surroundings? his
wife? There must be something odd
about her. She had always been shrouded
in mystery, but now the veil was about
to be pulled aside, and their long-starved
curiosity would be satisfied at last!</p>

<p>4.30 found Sir Reginald and his two
guests, comfortably settled in a smoking
carriage, slowly gliding out of Waterloo
Station <i>en route</i> for Monkswood; but,
owing to a stoppage on the line they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
arrived at Manister fully two hours behind
time.</p>

<p>“Anything here for me?” inquired
Sir Reginald of a gracious porter.</p>

<p>“No, sir; the dog-cart waited till the
half-hour and then went home; but Blake
said as how he would come for the
express.”</p>

<p>“How far is it to your place?” asked
Mr. Campell.</p>

<p>“Only two miles and a-half by the
fields.”</p>

<p>“Then I vote we walk. Anything is
better than a stifling fly this fine warm
evening. ‘Quick march’ is the word,” gaily
shouldering his umbrella.</p>

<p>His motion was carried unanimously,
and, leaving their luggage to be despatched
in their wake, they started off at a smart
pace, each armed with a cheroot.</p>

<p>The great event of the following day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
was the one topic of Mr. Campell’s conversation.
Sir Reginald lent him a ready
ear, and together they made arrangements
for an early visit to Tornado the next
morning; they discussed weights, saddles,
handicappers, and bits with much animation
and enthusiasm, Captain Vaughan
walking rather behind them, and smoking
sullenly.</p>

<p>“If he’s as good as you say, he ought
to be first past the post to-morrow, for
his company is, after all, only second rate;
and if he does pull off this race I want
you to promise me one thing, Campell.”</p>

<p>“I’ll promise you any earthly thing,
my dear fellow,” returned Captain Campell
impulsively, stopping for an instant in the
narrow moonlit path to give full emphasis
to his asseveration.</p>

<p>“You will sell Tornado directly the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
meeting is over and give up racing for
the next five years.”</p>

<p>“You may make your mind easy on
that score. ‘A burnt child dreads the
fire;’ and I have been badly singed. If
I can only pull my chestnuts out all
right this time I’ll never go near the
turf again.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“It is much easier to make good resolutions
than to keep them,” growled Captain
Vaughan from the rear. “If you lose,
no doubt it will be all plain sailing for
this high resolve of yours; but if you
win, it will be another matter. Having
once tasted blood, it will be hard to choke
off your racing instincts. Why not scratch
Tornado to-morrow and commence this
reformation before the race?”</p>

<p>“Hear him!” cried Captain Campell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
angrily; “and my four thousand and odd
pounds, where would they be? Your
advice is no doubt kindly meant, Vaughan;
but we all know that ‘<i>Il est plus facile
d’être sage pour les autres que de l’être
pour soi-même</i>.’ I shall not begin my
reformation, as you call it, until the day
after to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Half-an-hour’s brisk walking brought the
three pedestrians near Monkswood. They
crossed the park—how weird it looked in
the moonlight!—and the house itself—what
an imposing pile! They traversed the
smooth-shaven pleasure-ground and
ascended the shallow steps, where wide-open
French windows gave forth streams
of light and peals of laughter. They looked
in, and this is what they saw: A long,
low, old-fashioned room, brilliantly lighted
and most luxuriously furnished—flowers,
pictures, china, caught the eye on every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
side. A space had been cleared, and a
dancing lesson was evidently in full swing.
Close to the window, with her back to
them, stood a young lady in a pink dress;
beside her a portly middle-aged man was
holding out his coat-tails and capering insanely.
He was evidently being initiated
in the “trois temps” by a lovely girl
opposite, in black net, with quantities of
natural pale-blush roses pinned into the
bodice of her dress and her hair. She was
slim, graceful, beautiful, and looked about
nineteen. A handsome matron in black
satin was playing a waltz mechanically,
as she looked over her shoulder at the
dancing. An old lady in a monumental
cap was peering above her spectacles with
intense amusement, and a long-legged youth
had thrown himself into a chair in absolute
convulsions of laughter. Having at length
got breath, he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>“Go on, Alice; go on. Show him once
more.”</p>

<p>The young lady in black, thus adjured,
held up her dress in front and modestly
displayed a pair of the prettiest, most fairy-like
Louis Quatorze shoes and the slenderest
of black silk ankles.</p>

<p>“Now, Mark,” she said authoritatively,
“mind this is the <i>last</i> time. One foot
forward, so; bring up the other, and turn,
so, one, two, three—one, two, three; nothing
can be easier. Are you looking?”</p>

<p>“Of course he is looking. Do you take
him for a fool? Isn’t he looking at the
prettiest pair of ankles in Great Britain?”</p>

<p>“Geoffrey,” retorted the girl without
turning her head, “I’m coming to box
your ears directly. Go on, Mark,” she
proceeded encouragingly; “if I could only
reach round your waist I’d dance gentleman,
and then you would soon get into it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>Mark accordingly went on according to
his lights, and the result was a perfect roar
of laughter, in which Sir Reginald joined
most heartily, and so betrayed his whereabouts.
He and his friends advanced into
the room, and he presented them to the
girl in black.</p>

<p>“His wife!”</p>

<p>They had barely recovered from their
astonishment before she had left the room
to see about preparations for them, and to
order an impromptu supper, which was
speedily organised in a grand old dining-room.</p>

<p>Thither all proceeded, and a merrier party
seldom sat down at Monkswood. As lively
sallies and witty remarks were rapidly
bandied about, and topic after topic was
started, discussed, and dismissed, Captains
Vaughan and Campell’s eyes frequently
met.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>“Could this be Fairfax’s home, this lovely
girl his wife, and these charmingly amusing
well-bred people his relations? Then why
did he stay in India? Where was the
skeleton in the cupboard?”</p>

<p>He was telling a story he had heard in
town of an Irish wedding, where, by some
blunder, the best man drove off with the
bride by mistake. Declaring that to stop
was unlucky, nothing would induce the
coachman to pull up or turn back. Meanwhile
the wretched bridegroom was pursuing
them afoot, and running the gauntlet of a
score of ragamuffins, who pelted him with
stones and mud.</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> took precious good care that such
a mistake did not occur, Regy!” said
Geoffrey with a broad grin. “I had not
much chance of driving off with you, Alice,
had I? You remember how I wanted to
come with you in the carriage from church,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
and how he nearly slammed my fingers in
the door of the brougham, eh?”</p>

<p>Why did Lady Fairfax become scarlet,
and Fairfax assume an air of rapt consideration
of the pattern of the tablecloth?
Why did they so seldom address each other—what
was the meaning of the coolness
between them?</p>

<p>Captain Vaughan made up his mind to
watch them narrowly. But Captain Campell
was far too much taken up with the
topic nearest his heart to give the subject
more than passing attention, and said:</p>

<p>“Lady Fairfax, are you coming to the
races to-morrow? Capital races at Sundown.”</p>

<p>“N-o—I think not,” looking across at
her husband interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Oh!” responding to her glance, “<i>he</i> is
going right enough. He is to ride my horse,
don’t you know—Tornado. I can’t get a
jockey, and if I could now I would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
change for the best professional in
England.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that my husband is
going to ride?” she asked with a quaver
of consternation in her voice.</p>

<p>“Yes; it is awfully good of him, is it
not?”</p>

<p>“Awfully good of him,” she repeated
mechanically, her face as white as the
cloth.</p>

<p>“Reginald, you are not really going to
ride Tornado?” said Geoffrey incredulously.
“If you are, I hope you have made your
will.”</p>

<p>“I have made my will, and I have made
up my mind to ride Tornado. Come to the
races to-morrow and see him win.”</p>

<p>“Or see you killed,” replied Geoffrey;
“which?”</p>

<p>“You are a Job’s comforter with a vengeance.
Your remarks are certainly not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
calculated to inspire a nervous man with
confidence. Let us make a move to the
drawing-room,” observed Reginald, anxious
to avoid further discussion and the objections
he sees that Helen and Mark are
preparing to hurl at him, and determined
to postpone the struggle.</p>

<p>The party in the drawing-room scattered
about and broke up into groups of twos and
threes. Miss Ferrars and Captain Campell
strolled to the piano, and Captain Vaughan
laid himself out to improve his acquaintance
with Lady Fairfax. As he drew a chair
near the table at which she was sitting,
she said:</p>

<p>“Captain Vaughan, I am so very glad
to see you. I know how much I owe
you; how you nursed my husband through
the worst of his illness. I never can
sufficiently thank you——”</p>

<p>“Do not,” he interrupted, “it is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
necessary. I owe him more than that.
You do not know what a blow it would
have been to all of us if anything had
happened to him. You can’t think how
much he has made himself beloved by both
officers and men.”</p>

<p>Alice blushed deeply, and looked far
more pleased than if she had received a
direct personal compliment.</p>

<p>“I am sure he is,” she said in a low
voice. “Nevertheless, you must let me
thank you. I have often and often longed
to do so. I only wish I had some way
of showing you how grateful I am,” she
added, looking at him with dewy wistful
eyes.</p>

<p>“What a perfectly bewitching face!
What a domestic treasure Reginald has
kept quietly buried here! She would more
than hold her own with the best ‘professionals,’”
he mused as he glanced at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
her furtively, whilst he pulled his long
tawny moustache.</p>

<p>Reginald, and Reginald’s exploits, formed
the topic of their conversation. His hostess
made the very best of listeners, and eagerly
drank in all the details of her husband’s
campaign, his rash adventure, and his
illness.</p>

<p>“She is an angel!” thought Captain
Vaughan rapturously.</p>

<p>He was by no means a ladies’ man.
Nevertheless, it was a wholly gratifying
sensation to have this lovely young creature
hanging on his words, as though his lips
were veritably dropping the legendary
pearls and diamonds.</p>

<p>Presently the hero of his tale joined
them, and, throwing himself into an easy-chair,
said, as he crossed his legs:</p>

<p>“We must make an early start to-morrow,
Vaughan.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>“I suppose so,” responded his friend
discontentedly. “I think the whole thing
is madness! You are not fit to ride a
race. I wonder”—turning abruptly to
Alice—“I wonder you allow him to ride,
Lady Fairfax.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could prevent him,” she replied,
with an appealing look towards her
husband.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you enforce your wifely
authority?”</p>

<p>The subject of their conversation was
apparently engrossed in the contemplation
of his exceedingly well-cut boots, and did
not seem to hear them.</p>

<p>“Do you hear, Fairfax? Your wife
takes my view altogether. You are not
to ride to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“My wife,” he replied, looking up and
transferring his eyes to her, “knows
perfectly well that we never interfere in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
each other’s affairs. ‘Live and let live’
is our motto, is it not, Alice?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she responded with a forced
smile; but she added timidly: “I do
very much wish you would not ride for
Mr. Campell, he is a most dangerous animal.
You heard what Geoffrey said.”</p>

<p>“Said that Mr. Campell was a dangerous
animal?” he asked, with a look of comical
interrogation.</p>

<p>“No,” she replied petulantly; “the
horse I mean. Please do not ride him.
I will only ask this once,” she pleaded
earnestly.</p>

<p>“Sorry I can’t oblige you, Alice. I
have given my word—and you know,” he
added significantly, “I never break <i>my</i>
promises.”</p>

<p>Alice, deeply hurt, turned away to hide
her discomposure, and joined the group at
the piano without another word. Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
Vaughan looked at his friend with unmeasured
indignation; certainly he did
not shine in home life. There had been
a time when he thought no woman under
the sun a fitting mate for Sir Reginald
Fairfax; but now it appeared to him that
Sir Reginald was hardly worthy of his
wife!</p>

<p>Could she be the very same Alice to
whom, when he thought himself dying,
his last words and messages were sent?
“Tell her I loved her—always!” Loved
her, indeed! He has a curious way of
showing it, thought his brother-officer with
rising anger.</p>

<p>His looks of unqualified disapproval were
entirely thrown away on his friend, who
was busily endeavouring to balance a paper-cutter
on the tip of one of his fingers,
and never once raised his eyes. Captain
Vaughan, rising suddenly, and giving his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
chair a violent push, that was in itself
an angry expostulation, went over to the
piano and joined the rest of the party
in begging their hostess for just one
song.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When all had left the drawing-room,
excepting her husband, Alice lingered behind.
He was setting the clock on the
mantelpiece and did not observe her
where she was kneeling, beside the piano,
putting away some music. When all the
songs and books had been neatly arranged
she stole a glance at him. He was standing
with his back to the fireplace, just as she
had seen him for the first time at Malta;
but oh, how different he was! He looked
sterner and older, and instead of a gay
smile there was a hard cynical expression
on his lips as he gazed into vacancy.</p>

<p>She felt that she was afraid of him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
but, all the same, she would speak and
endeavour to dissuade him from riding
for Captain Campell. No matter what
he said, no matter how he froze her, she
would be heard; she was his wife.</p>

<p>Rising to her feet, she approached slowly
and hesitatingly. Her husband eyed her
with cool surprise as she came close up
to him.</p>

<p>“Reginald,” she said, “will nothing prevent
your riding this race to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” he calmly replied, “unless
the horse dies.”</p>

<p>“Could not Burke, the groom, ride him?
He was a jockey once,” she asked timidly.</p>

<p>“Burke!” contemptuously. “Burke
weighs at least twelve stone. His riding
days are over. Why not suggest Mark
at once?” with a supercilious smile.</p>

<p>“Could you not get some substitute?”</p>

<p>“No. Pray why should I? Campell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
has asked me to ride—I have consented.
<i>Voilà tout.</i>”</p>

<p>“But,” she urged, nervously twisting her
bangles, “I do wish you would have nothing
to say to him. They say the reason Captain
Campell could not get a jockey was that the
horse had such a bad name. Say you will
not ride him,” she pleaded brokenly. “Do,
for <i>my</i> sake. I will tell Captain Campell
that he must find another jockey, as I
will not allow you to ride.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know on what grounds you
should ask me to do anything for your
sake.”</p>

<p>A silence.</p>

<p>“As to not allowing me to ride,” he
continued with polite irony, “I’m afraid
I cannot admit your authority.”</p>

<p>He felt he was brutally rude; but in
rudeness was his safety. Another such
look as she had just given him and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
was a lost man. The farce of “Ward
not Wife” would be played out, all his
stern resolutions thrown to the winds, and
he would have to surrender his pride,
his self-respect, his word of honour. She
was so close to him that he could feel
the perfume of the roses in her hair and
see a stray eyelash on her cheek. He
moved to one side and, steadily looking
at the floor, said:</p>

<p>“I could not break my word to Campell.
If Tornado wins to-morrow he has promised
me to give up his stud. If he loses, he
will be ruined, and will have to sell out.
Besides, it is not a steeplechase, only a
flat race. Nothing very alarming in that,
is there?”</p>

<p>“Not quite so bad; but bad enough.
The horse did kill one man, why not
another?” looking awfully white.</p>

<p>“Well, if he kills me to-morrow”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
(cheerfully), “you can put it in your
marriage settlements that your second
husband is not to ride races.”</p>

<p>Without another word or look, Alice
turned and left the room.</p>

<p>“Stay a moment,” said her husband,
cutting off her indignant retreat across
the hall and politely lighting her candle.
“Listen to me, Alice. What will you give
me if, after to-morrow, I promise never
to ride another race?” looking at her with
serious eyes.</p>

<p>“Will you promise me that” (eagerly)
“really and truly?” accepting the candlestick.
“Then it is to be a bargain,
remember.”</p>

<p>“How can it be a bargain, as you call it,
if the transaction is to be all on one side?
If I promise this, what are you going
to do for me?” he asked with questioning
gaze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>“Promise, and I’ll tell you,” she said
archly.</p>

<p>“Well,” speaking slowly and with grave
expectation in his eyes, “I promise; and
what then?”</p>

<p>“Then, if you like,” she replied, blushing
furiously and holding her candle well
between his face and hers, “then I’ll—I’ll
give you a kiss.”</p>

<p>“A kiss!” he stammered, very much
taken aback. “A kiss,” he repeated, reddening;
for a second he hesitated, then
said in a low voice, as he turned to take
up his candle: “No, thank you, Alice.”</p>

<p>Alice seized the opportunity to make
her escape, and when her husband had
turned his head she was gone.</p>

<p>“After that,” he muttered to himself
as he leisurely ascended the stairs, “I can
resist anything. I have put St. Anthony
himself completely in the shade. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
temptress was not a quarter as pretty as
mine, I’ll swear. But if I had taken it
I should have had to take a dozen, and
thus lay down my arms. Better as it is,
better as it is; I’m not likely to be tempted
in the same way twice,” he added with a
sigh.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Alice had fled along the long
corridor and locked herself in her dressing-room.
“No, thank you, Alice,” was still
ringing in her ears. She sat with her face
buried in her hands for nearly a quarter of
an hour. To have offered a kiss to a man
and been refused, even though that man
was her husband, what shame, what indignity!
Her very throat and forehead were
dyed with blushes as she thought of it.
“What does he mean? Why does he treat
me so? He dislikes me, that is very
evident. Am I uglier, less attractive than
I used to be? Did he marry me <i>only</i> for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
my pretty face, and am I pretty no longer?”
she asked herself as she looked into her
glass. But no, the glass declared she was
prettier than ever, as, with both elbows on
the table, she studied her reflection critically,
and saw clouds of lovely golden-brown hair,
perfect features, a flawless skin, over which
the blushes were chasing each other rapidly.
“I am as pretty as ever,” she said to herself
dispassionately. “Can he be a little
wrong in his head?” she mused. “Can
his wounds and the Indian sun have affected
his reason? Mad people always evince a
dislike to their nearest and dearest; but no,
impossible. Reginald mad? she must be
insane herself to think so; and oh, doubly,
trebly mad to have put herself in the way
of meeting such a rebuff as she had received
that evening.”</p>

</div>


<p>The next morning all was bustle and confusion
at Monkswood; the Mayhews and
Miss Ferrars had decided to go to the races,
and the high-stepping, supercilious-looking
carriage-horses were to do a good day’s
work for once.</p>

<p>Nothing would induce Alice to join the
party, but she busied herself all the morning
looking after the cold luncheon which was
to be taken to the course, and helping
Helen and Mary to make gorgeous race
toilettes. By mutual consent, she and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
husband had carefully avoided each other,
but just as the latter was about to start, he
discovered that a button was coming off
his light overcoat. The dog-cart, in which
Captain Campell was already seated, was
waiting at the door, and there was not a
moment to be lost.</p>

<p>“Call Alice,” cried the ever-officious
Geoffrey; “she has just mended me.
There she is in the hall.”</p>

<p>“Alice, come here with your needle.”</p>

<p>Alice, entering the library, found that
she had to operate on her husband this
time, which was more than either of them
had bargained for; but there was no help
for it, with Captain Vaughan and Geoffrey
standing by. She had scarcely commenced
her task ere they left the room and went
out to the dog-cart, leaving her alone with
Reginald. She ventured to steal a glance
at him, he stood still as a statue, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
so much as the flickering of an eyelash,
whilst her fingers trembled a good deal,
and her heart beat so loudly she was
afraid he could hear it. As he had not
removed his coat they were brought into
uncommonly close contact, and the top
of her head was dangerously near to his
moustache. Very quickly and silently she
stitched, without again raising her eyes.
Through his open coat she perceived his
scarlet silk racing-jacket and faultless
breeches and boots.</p>

<p>“What are you looking so serious
about?” he suddenly asked. “Why are
you so pale? There is no occasion to
keep up appearances; we are alone. Pray
don’t feign anxiety about me—that you
really don’t feel; you know very well
you don’t care a straw whether I break
my neck or not.”</p>

<p>He was in a merciless humour; many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
sleepless hours had he brooded on his
wrongs, and wrath and contempt were
uppermost.</p>

<p>Alice made no reply, but having sewn
on the button, twisted the thread off with a
sharp snap.</p>

<p>“Well, good-bye,” he said, holding out
a dogskin-covered hand and looking at
her keenly. “Don’t overact the part. At
present you are superb. Any bystander
now would be fool enough to think——that
you cared for me. You and I know
better than <i>that</i>, don’t we?” he added,
with a curious smile, as he opened his
cigar-case and carefully selected a cheroot.</p>

<p>“Rex, are you coming?” shouted Geoffrey.
In another moment he had taken his seat
in the dog-cart, the pawing, fiery chestnut
had “got his head,” and the trio were
bowling down the avenue at a liberal
ten miles an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>Alice stood in the window for fully
twenty minutes; her lips trembled, her
bosom heaved.</p>

<p>“How dared he! How dared he!” she
whispered, as the blood mounted to her
pale face, and her whole frame quivered
with anger at his taunts. But her indignation,
as was usually the case, quickly
died away—it gave place to “apprehension’s
sudden glow.” “Supposing he was
brought home badly hurt—or dead? Supposing
that those dark eyes, that had just
now looked at her so scornfully, were
closed for ever ere nightfall?” The very
idea was more than she could bear.
She would busy herself all day, and not
give herself time to think.</p>

<p>Drying her eyes, she ran upstairs, and
helped Helen and Mary to put the finishing
touches to their toilettes; and pressed on
Mary a perfect parasol, arranged Helen’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
bonnet and veil satisfactorily, and saw
them off from the hall-door steps with
many smiles and good wishes.</p>

<p>Although Alice wore a smiling face in
public, and her gaiety and buoyant spirits
were the amazement of Helen and her
aunt, yet her heart was heavy enough, and
when alone, escorted by the dogs, strolling
through the woods with idle aimless footsteps,
her face was very downcast and sad.
The task of regaining her husband’s affection
seemed to be altogether beyond her;
all her advances were coldly repulsed; she
would venture no farther. Perhaps were
she to emulate his own studied indifference,
he might think more of her.</p>

<p>Men never cared for what was easily
gained; probably he despised her for her
humility. Well, she would assert herself,
and meet him on his own ground as
a last resource. “He pleases himself;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
I shall please myself, and I shall
ride Cardigan this very afternoon,” she
said aloud, as she entered the hall and
flung her hat on a chair.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Sundown races were very popular, and
the present meeting augured a great
success. The stand was crowded, and the
course at either side was lined three deep
with carriages, gay with bonnets and
parasols. Every small eminence and
every box-seat was seized as a coign of
vantage.</p>

<p>As the big race of the day was about
to be run, five starters emerged from the
paddock, slender and sleek-coated, mounted
by jockeys gorgeous in every colour of the
rainbow.</p>

<p>Tornado’s appearance excited considerable
sensation as he took his preliminary canter.
He was a remarkably handsome animal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
and was handled to admiration by his
jockey.</p>

<p>“Who is the fellow riding him?” asked
one of the Steepshire magnates. “Seems
to know what he is about. That brute takes
a lot of riding.”</p>

<p>“It’s ten to one if he does not bolt,”
replied a supremely horsey little man. “If
he could be kept on the course he’d run
away with the race, but he has a nasty
awkward temper and a gentleman jock
riding him. Precious little good his four
pounds will do him in this case. They are
making Dado a hot favourite.”</p>

<p>“Who is the gentleman jock?” reiterated
his companion.</p>

<p>On reference to the correct card,
they saw “Captain Campell’s Tornado;
scarlet jacket, black cap, Sir Reginald
Fairfax.”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” exclaimed a pompous D.L.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
“who would expect to see him here?
Good-looking fellow—wonder he likes to
come into the neighbourhood, considering
all things. Wonder where he is stopping?”</p>

<p>The flag dropped to a capital start, and
they were off, Tornado making a determined
but useless attempt to bolt. Those
wrists that were guiding him were of steel,
and kept him on the course willy-nilly.
He had his master on his back, he soon discovered;
his runaway tendency was turned
to good account, for his rider, knowing him
to be a stayer, forced him through the
other horses, and cut out the work at a
terrific pace, which he kept up throughout,
having a clear lead halfway up
the straight, and winning easily by six
lengths.</p>

<p>Sir Reginald, who was now recognised
by many of the neighbouring gentry and
farmers, who remembered him a lad on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
pony, was cheered loudly as he piloted
his horse through the crowd to the weighing-stand.
Some of the neighbouring <i>élite</i>
came up and claimed his acquaintance,
and overpowered him with congratulations.
He received them with a distant politeness
none knew how to assume better than
himself, and declining various offers of
luncheon, arm-in-arm with the radiant
Captain Campell, made his way to the
Fairfax landau, where he was received as a
hero indeed. <i>This</i> victory was something
palpable, and Helen felt a pleasing consciousness
that their carriage was the cynosure
of many eyes and many opera-glasses, as
her cousin shared the box-seat with Mary
Ferrars.</p>

<p>“Where is she?” was whispered behind
more than one fan among the ladies on the
stand. “How odd it is that he should have
come into the neighbourhood! How handsome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
he is, and how much he is to be pitied,
poor fellow!”</p>

<p>The “poor fellow” made a capital
luncheon, lost several pairs of gloves to the
two ladies, and suddenly announced his
intention of going home.</p>

<p>“Going home?” echoed Geoffrey; “why
there are two more races on the card. You
are not serious?” he said, gazing at him
with might and main.</p>

<p>“I am, indeed; the best of the day is
over, and I want to get off before the crowd
begins to make a rush. You can all stay if
you like.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you,” said Captain Vaughan;
“I’m sick of races, and we will jog home
quietly and escape the dust.”</p>

<p>Well he guessed his friend’s intention—he
was going home to set his wife’s mind
at rest, and he <i>was</i>. Her pale face and
trembling fingers had risen up more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
once reproachfully before his mind’s eye,
and he felt both remorseful and penitent for
his undoubted rudeness. Cautiously steering
through the crowd, they were soon on
their road home, smoking and discussing
the events of the day as they trotted
through the cool country lanes; both had
the pleasing inward conviction that they
were doing the “right thing.”</p>

<p>Within a mile of Monkswood the sound
of a horse galloping close by in a field
arrested their attention. Soon he came in
sight—a powerful raking chestnut, ridden
by a lady. Pulling him up gradually to a
canter, she trotted him up to a hog-backed
stile, over which she landed him in the most
workmanlike manner into the road, a hundred
yards ahead of the dog-cart, which
evidently was a vehicle not to his taste, for
the instant he caught sight of it he turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
sharp round and bolted in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>The lady was Alice, the horse Cardigan.
In two minutes she had reduced him to
obedience, and, returning at a trot, ranged
up alongside of the dog-cart. Her light
hand seemed to have a wonderfully soothing
effect on the fiery fretting chestnut. She had
evidently given him a good gallop, if one
was to judge by the state of heat he was in
and the lather on his sides, and so subdued
his exuberant impulses, but his wild eye
and nervous ears spoke volumes: “Only for
the lady on my back,” they said, “I would
think very little of jumping into that dog-cart.”</p>

<p>“So you have come back?” exclaimed
Alice cheerfully, “and not on a shutter,”
with a glance at her husband.</p>

<p>“So you see,” he replied shortly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>“After all, it was only a flat race! I
need not have been so frightened. Did you
win?”</p>

<p>“He did, splendidly! by six lengths,
hands down,” replied Captain Vaughan
enthusiastically. “You ought to have
been there to see for yourself, Lady
Fairfax. There has been capital racing.”</p>

<p>“What has brought you home so
early?” she asked, not noticing his suggestion.</p>

<p>“Oh, we had had enough of it; the best
races had been run, and we thought we
would get away before the crowd.”</p>

<p>“Alice,” said her husband, suddenly tossing
away his cigar, “I thought I had
forbidden you to ride Cardigan?”</p>

<p>“Did you!” she replied airily; “just in
the same way that I <i>forbid</i> you to ride
races,” and she laughed as she leant over
and patted Cardigan’s neck. “‘Live and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
let live’ is our motto, is it not, Captain
Vaughan?”</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> won’t live long, at any rate, if
you persist in riding that brute,” returned
her husband angrily.</p>

<p>“He calls you a brute, Mr. C.; do you
hear that? You and I understand each
other perfectly,” she said, stooping forward
again and patting his hard neck, thereby
more fully displaying her perfect figure and
her perfectly-cut habit.</p>

<p>“You have torn your glove, Lady
Fairfax. Why, the whole palm is gone!”
exclaimed Captain Vaughan.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s nothing,” she replied, looking
at it hurriedly, but not before a deep red
weal across her delicate white palm was
visible to both gentlemen.</p>

<p>“He pulls a good bit, does he not?”
asked Captain Vaughan dubiously.</p>

<p>“A little, when he is fresh; but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
knows me. All the grooms are afraid of
him, and he knows that; but I’m not a
bit afraid of you, am I?” addressing herself
once more to her steed, and emphasizing
her remark with a touch of her whip.</p>

<p>His reply was a plunge that would have
unseated a less experienced rider. Another
touch of the whip—another plunge.</p>

<p>Captain Vaughan looked askance at his
friend. For a man who had just won a
race, on an awkward horse, in a first-class
manner, he looked decidedly nervous.
Never had Captain Vaughan seen fear
written on Reginald Fairfax’s face till
now, and there it was plainly to be seen,
as Cardigan executed plunge after plunge
before them down the road. Subdued at
last by his mistress’s voice, they again
joined the dog-cart.</p>

<p>“Alice,” said her husband, administering
a wicked but quiet cut to the dog-cart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
horse, “you’ll never ride Cardigan again
after to-day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shan’t I? Who is to prevent
me?” she asked, innocent wonder depicted
on her pretty face.</p>

<p>“I will,” he replied emphatically.</p>

<p>“Do not be too sure of that,” she returned,
with a smile at Captain Vaughan
that exasperated her husband beyond
description. “Farewell for the present;
here is a lovely piece of turf,” and with a
careless wave of her hand she turned off
the avenue and was soon galloping away
across the park at the top of Cardigan’s
speed.</p>

<p>The two young men watched her in dead
silence till she disappeared behind a clump
of trees.</p>

<p>“By Jove, how she rides!” exclaimed
Captain Vaughan in a tone of enthusiastic
admiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>“Vaughan,” said his friend solemnly, as
he withdrew his eyes from the vanishing
horsewoman, “let me give you a piece of
advice; take it as coming from one who
speaks from experience. Whatever folly—whatever
madness you may be guilty of,
be warned by me, and <i>never marry</i>!”</p>

</div>


<p>Mr. and Mrs. Mayhew had gone on a
visit to some friends at the other end of
the county, and the young people, left
to their own devices, instituted a riding-party
into Manister. Alice was mounted
on a new purchase—a perfect animal in
appearance and manner—a bay mare with
black points, who fully justified the name
she had brought with her—“Look at
Me”—and the three hundred guineas
Sir Reginald had paid to her late owner.
Cardigan he reserved for himself, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
Cardigan, in mad spirits, kept plunging and
shying and indulging in formidable antics
all the way down the avenue, setting an
infamous example to the other horses.</p>

<p>“I must take it out of this fellow,”
said his master, sending him at a low
fence that separated the road from a long
series of large grass fields.</p>

<p>In another instant Look at Me was
beside him. Together they galloped the
length of three or four fields, their riders
just steadying them at their fences, which
consisted of one or two low hedges, a
couple of sheep hurdles, and a semi-Irish
bank.</p>

<p>The pace, the breeze, and, above all,
the exhilarating exercise, made Alice’s
spirits rise to quite their former standard.
With brilliant cheeks and sparkling eyes
she looked the Alice of other days.</p>

<p>Bringing his horse to a walk, and casting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
an approving glance at his companion, her
husband said:</p>

<p>“I see you ride as well as ever, Alice,
if not better!”</p>

<p>“I am fonder of it, if that is anything,”
she replied, giving her habit a businesslike
twitch. “It’s the only thing I care for in
the way of amusement. I seem to be able
to ride away from myself, to forget all
my troubles, and to be Alice Saville once
more.”</p>

<p>“You would like to be Alice Saville
again, no doubt,” said her husband quietly,
looking at her steadily.</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>“Alice, did you hear me?” leaning
towards her and placing his hand on her
horse’s crest.</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard you. You are not my
father confessor, be pleased to remember,”
she replied, closing her lips resolutely. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
felt an insane desire to tease him, and
proceeded: “Perhaps, if you tell me two
or three things, I will tell you.”</p>

<p>“Go on, then. What do you wish to
know?”</p>

<p>“In the first place, am I as pretty as
I was as Alice Saville?”</p>

<p>“Really—I—I have never given the
subject a thought.” (Oh Reginald!)</p>

<p>“Well; go on. I’m waiting.”</p>

<p>“Yes”—looking at her boldly and taking
in every item of her fair high-bred face,
mischievous smile, and lovely laughing
eyes—“I suppose you are.”</p>

<p>What a rude, indefinite way of putting
it!</p>

<p>“Is my riding as good as ever?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” most emphatically.</p>

<p>“Is my temper improved?”</p>

<p>“How can I tell? I have had no
practical demonstration of one of your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
passions as yet. But I should say—your
temper was now as equable and unruffled
as the corn in that field.”</p>

<p>“How is <i>yours</i>?” abruptly.</p>

<p>“Mine! Much as usual, thank you,”
with an amused, superior smile.</p>

<p>“Well, now, as you have answered my
questions, it is only fair to answer yours.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, looking at her
eagerly.</p>

<p>“I would rather”—emphasizing every
word—“be Alice <i>Somebody</i> than anyone
else in the whole world. <i>Now</i> are you
much wiser?” she added, giving him a
mischievous glance.</p>

<p>“Of course! I <span class="allsmcap">KNOW</span>, Alice, although
you won’t tell me. But even if we had
never met, you would not be Alice Saville
now; so what is the good of wishing
for your maiden-name? You would have
been married long ago—subject to my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
consent,” with a sardonic smile he could
not express.</p>

<p>“We <i>were</i> very happy once, Reg,” she
said with a deep sigh. “Neither of us
had tempers—once. Have you forgotten?”</p>

<p>He has not forgotten; he never can
forget. Nevertheless, he abruptly put an
end to her reminiscences, saying:</p>

<p>“Alice, there is nothing to be gained
by referring to the past, nothing but pain.
My past is dead and buried; the sooner
you put yours under the ground the better.
<i>Never</i> allude to our married life again.
Let it be as though it had never been;
it was a <i>fiasco</i>, a <span class="allsmcap">MISTAKE</span>! We have
only to deal with the present and the
future.”</p>

<p>“The present and the future,” she
echoed, choking back her tears.</p>

<p>The sound of their horses’ hoofs on the
soft springy turf was the only sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
that broke the silence for more than ten
minutes. Presently she said:</p>

<p>“What is <i>your</i> future?—what are you
going to do?”</p>

<p>“I mean to have a look at Looton, a
winter’s hunting in the shires, and to
return to India in the spring.”</p>

<p>“To India!” she gasped. “Reginald,
does it ever, <i>ever</i> strike you how cruel
you are to me?”</p>

<p>“Cruel!” he echoed, looking into her
wistful beautiful eyes with stern self-command.
“God help you, Alice, if I was
ever as cruel to you as you have been
to me. Come,” he added, putting his
horse into a canter, “here is the lane
to the Manister road; we had better
get on.”</p>

<p>Somehow, Alice’s attempts at explanation
or reconciliation were always failures.
Her husband declined to meet her halfway.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
He looked so cold and so unsympathetic
that the words that came trembling to her
lips died away unspoken, frozen into silence
by the icy chilliness of his demeanour.
Firm and intrepid resolutions she had
made to brave him came to nothing when
she found herself alone with him face to
face. He would talk on any other topic
but themselves—their past. He cantered
up the lane in front of her without even
turning his head. Had he glanced backwards,
he would have seen what would
have surprised him considerably—Alice
hastily searching in the saddle-pocket for
her handkerchief and furtively wiping away
some distinctly visible tears.</p>

<p>The long grass lane terminated in a
locked gate—a gate opening on the
Manister road—over which Cardigan
showed the way in gallant style, closely
followed by the bay and blue habit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>“Oh how pretty! How easy it looks!”
exclaimed Mary Ferrars, as she and Geoffrey
trotted up just in time to witness the
performance.</p>

<p>“It’s not often you see a married couple
ride like <i>that</i>,” returned Geoffrey complacently,
“and it’s just the only subject
on which they agree.”</p>

<p>They all rode into the town together,
where they again divided—Geoffrey and
Mary to go to the confectioner’s—an errand
for Maurice—Alice and Reginald to despatch
a telegram. When they came to the post-office,
two carriages were already drawn up,
containing some of the Steepshire <i>monde</i>.</p>

<p>They favoured Alice and her cavalier
with an impertinent stare, or looked over
her head with fixed attention.</p>

<p>One old lady adjusted her pince-nez, and
amused herself by staring Alice out of
countenance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>When her husband had despatched the
telegram he came out, and saw at a glance
the contemptuous looks levelled at his wife,
her burning cheeks and downcast eyes. In
a second he grasped the situation, and
turning on the carriages a look of scathing
indignation, he mounted his horse, and,
unintentionally ramming in the spurs, that
fiery animal became almost unmanageable,
and, rearing erect, nearly overbalanced into
one of the landaus; but having regained
his equilibrium, went plunging violently
down the street.</p>

<p>“Who is the young man she has the
effrontery to ride with?” asked the old lady
with the glasses.</p>

<p>“Don’t know, I’m sure. Looks like a
cavalry man,” responded her daughter languidly.
“Better ask Smith.”</p>

<p>Mr. Smith, postmaster, who was standing
at his shop-door, looking after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
equestrians, and briskly rubbing his hands,
said, in reply to her question:</p>

<p>“Certainly, ma’am, certainly,” clearing
his throat and preparing to deliver what he
knows will be a startling announcement.
“You mean the gentleman on the chestnut
horse, just turning into Market Street?”</p>

<p>An eager nod of assent.</p>

<p>“That is Sir Reginald, Lady Fairfax’s
husband.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!”</p>

<p>“Well, ma’am, he has just sent off a
telegram in that name.”</p>

<p>Sensation!</p>

<p>As the Monkswood party were leaving
the town they encountered a very dashing
victoria and pair, which stopped, and Alice
was beckoned to by a sprightly dark-eyed
lady with a rose-lined parasol.</p>

<p>“My <i>dear</i> Lady Fairfax, this is most
apropos! I have been over to Monkswood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
to tell you that I won’t take <i>any</i> refusal,
but must insist on you and Miss Ferrars
coming to my dance on Wednesday. You
will stay and sleep of course. The excuse
you gave was most frivolous and ridiculous.”</p>

<p>“Many thanks, Lady Rufford. Let me
introduce my husband, who has just returned
from India.”</p>

<p>Lady Rufford received the dark <i>distingué</i>-looking
gentleman who was presented to
her with effusion, and plied him with
questions more or less embarrassing. Before
they parted it was agreed that they would
all be present at her ball without fail.</p>

<p>Alice and Geoffrey dropped behind together,
on the way home, exchanging
lively sallies and critical observations.</p>

<p>“I say, Alice, doesn’t it look as if Rex
was getting up a strong flirtation with
Miss Ferrars? What is he leaning over,
and saying to her? Are you jealous?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t be absurd, Geoff.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you think Rex can’t flirt,
you pretty little confiding innocent! <i>Can’t</i>
he though! They used to say that when
he did go in for it, which was seldom
enough, he could give any fellow a week’s
start with a girl and cut him out after
all.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe a word of it,”
commencing to trot.</p>

<p>“Oh, you can please yourself about
that. Remember you are warned. Come
along, and let us interrupt their <i>tête-à-tête</i>
before your domestic peace is wholly
destroyed.”</p>

<p>Riding close up behind the other pair
he sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Will you walk a little faster,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Said a whiting to a snail,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s a lobster close behind me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And he’s treading on my tail.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>
<p>“Miss Ferrars,” he continued, “there’s
a glorious bit of turf; come and have a
canter.”</p>

<p>This well-meant effort had no effect in
readjusting the party; they all started
together, and the ride was completed by
a spirited neck-and-neck race between
Alice and Geoffrey across the park.</p>

<p>The same evening, after dinner, it being
a splendid moonlight night, they all strolled
out about the pleasure-ground, except Miss
Saville, who had too much regard for her
rheumatic old bones. The French windows
in the drawing-room opened on a terrace
which led down by a flight of steps to a
broad gravel walk. Mary and Reginald
had come in, and were standing just inside
the open window. Alice and Geoffrey had
lingered behind, quarrelling, as usual. They
could hear their fresh young voices coming
up the walk in high argument. Reaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
the steps, Alice sat down on the lowest
and said:</p>

<p>“Now, Geoff, a truce to nonsense. Be
a good boy, and I’ll tell your fortune with
this daisy.”</p>

<p>“I’d much rather you would give me
a kiss,” he replied, stealing a black arm
round her taper white waist.</p>

<p>Mary felt Reginald, who was standing
close to her, wince. “Ah, my friend,”
she thought, “you are not altogether so
cold or indifferent as you seem!”</p>

<p>Alice, perfectly unconscious of the
close proximity of her cousin’s arm, went
on:</p>

<p>“He loves me—a little, very much,
passionately; not at all, a little, very much.
She loves you—<i>very much</i>. I was sure
of it! The red-haired girl at Southsea.
It’s all very well to know the state of
<i>her</i> affections, but you must not think of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
it. I would never give my consent—never,
much less a wedding present.”</p>

<p>“I would a great deal rather have a
kiss now, my pretty little cousin.”</p>

<p>“What on earth put kisses into your
head, you ridiculous boy?”</p>

<p>“<i>You!</i>” said he, drawing her towards
him and endeavouring to imprint a salute
on her fair cheek.</p>

<p>But he reckoned without his hostess.
Like lightning she sprang to her feet and
confronted him with flaming cheeks and
dilated eyes.</p>

<p>“How dare you forget yourself? How—how
dare you insult me—me, a married
woman? If you <i>had</i> kissed me I should
have considered myself degraded indeed,
and never spoken to you again as long
as I lived.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” sarcastically; “what a loss!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by such conduct,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
sir?” stamping her foot. Her breast was
heaving, her hands trembling. She looked,
and she was, in a towering passion.</p>

<p>“What a little cat you are! What a
little fury! No <i>wonder</i> Rex had a rough
time of it. What harm if I did kiss you,
my own sweet-tempered first cousin?” said
Geoffrey. “I often kiss Dolly and Mary
Saville—and why not you?”</p>

<p>“It would have been an outrage. No
one ever has, ever shall kiss me, except—except——”
she stammered.</p>

<p>“Except—how many? Don’t be bashful.”</p>

<p>“Except Reginald, of course,” she replied
with passionate vehemence.</p>

<p>“What a good joke! You don’t really
say so?” he exclaimed with a sneering
laugh. “By all accounts <i>he</i> has never
had many of your kisses. He wouldn’t
be <i>bothered</i> with them,” proceeded this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
extremely aggravating youth. “He would
rather be leading a squadron of cavalry
than kissing the prettiest girl in England;
and he is not such a dog in the manger
as to refuse me a few of what he never
takes himself.”</p>

<p>“Let me pass, sir!” cried Alice, sweeping
him aside and dashing up the steps,
where she found herself face to face with
her husband and Mary. “Eavesdroppers!”
she exclaimed with a start.</p>

<p>“Quite unintentionally so,” replied Mary.
“And at any rate you have not committed
yourself in any way.”</p>

<p>“More than you can say for Geoffrey!”
cried Alice, giving him a glance of ineffable
contempt as he leisurely ascended the steps,
not the least disconcerted by the situation.</p>

<p>“He only meant it as a joke, or at
least as a mark of cousinly affection,” said
Reginald, who, <i>had</i> Geoffrey succeeded in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
robbing Alice of a kiss, would have
probably acted in a manner that would
have surprised them both considerably.
Fortunately, Geoffrey had been baffled,
those pure sweet lips were still sacred to
him; Alice was as loyal to him as he had
been to her. The mere thought of this
opened his heart to all the world, Geoffrey
included.</p>

<p>“Forgive him this once,” Reginald said,
“and I’ll be surety it never occurs again.”</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> take his part then?” she retorted
hotly.</p>

<p>The more indignant she was the more her
husband’s spirits rose.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, I said nothing of taking
anyone’s part; but I am quite certain that
Geoffrey will never offend again.”</p>

<p>Seeing that Alice made no reply, and
looked anything but appeased as she stood
tapping one foot impatiently on the flags:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>“Shall I,” he continued, with one of his
old and now very rare smiles, “parade
Geoffrey at twelve paces to-morrow on the
tennis-ground? I’m afraid there will be
some difficulty about weapons and seconds.
My revolver and Maurice’s pop-gun are the
only pistols available. We might toss for
the revolver, eh, Geoffrey?”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, if you are going to treat
the whole thing as a jest,” broke in Alice
indignantly, “there is no more to be said,”
turning away to enter the house.</p>

<p>“Come, Alice,” interposed her husband
more seriously, “be sensible, be reasonable.
Do you wish me to treat the matter as
anything but a <i>joke</i>?” he asked, looking
at her fixedly, and dropping his voice so
as to be heard by her ear alone. Then
resuming his former tone he went on:
“It would never do to allow such good
friends to quarrel; permit me to patch up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
a truce, if not a lasting peace, between you
and Geoffrey. Let me see you seal the
reconciliation by shaking hands.”</p>

<p>“I shall <i>not</i> shake hands with him,”
responded Alice, drawing herself up. “Let
him beg my pardon first,” putting her
hands behind her and looking the picture
of offended dignity.</p>

<p>“Here goes then,” returned Geoffrey,
taking out his handkerchief and spreading
it on the terrace with careful deliberation;
then, dropping on it in a kneeling posture,
with uplifted hands, he was commencing a
long oration, in a whining tone.</p>

<p>“Go away—don’t speak to me! You turn
everything into ridicule,” cried Alice hotly.</p>

<p>“See how I am snubbed, Miss Ferrars,”
he observed, rising, and dusting the knees
of his trousers; “all because I wanted to
kiss my cousin! Where was the harm?
Don’t all your cousins kiss you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>“I’m not bound to answer such an
impertinent question,” replied Mary,
laughing.</p>

<p>“Well, never mind. Suppose you take
me for a nice little moonlight walk, and
give me your confidence. I am afraid to
stay here,” waving his handkerchief towards
Alice.</p>

<p>In another moment they had descended
the steps together, leaving Alice and her
husband alone.</p>

<p>The former made an earnest effort for
composure as she stood for some moments
gazing out on the woods, which lay black
and silver in the moonlight. Presently she
turned and looked at her husband. He was
leaning against the window-frame, the white
background of which brought into bold
relief the strength and symmetry of his
figure. He was looking at her intently,
with an amused smile on his lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>A horrible thought that smile suggested
to Alice’s excited brain. He was laughing
at her in his sleeve; he had told Geoffrey!
The very idea made her giddy.</p>

<p>“Alice, I began to think you had forgotten
how to fly into a passion. I see I
was mistaken.”</p>

<p>“You were,” defiantly, measuring him
from head to foot. “I was mistaken also;
I thought you were a gentleman.”</p>

<p>A momentary, almost imperceptible start,
and then he replied coldly:</p>

<p>“I thought so, too.”</p>

<p>“But you are not.” A dead silence.
“You know it is true.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” he replied icily, “whatever
you say is undeniable. Once you told me
you despised and detested me; now I am
no gentleman. So be it. You have no
objection to smoking, as well as I can
remember?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>Provoked beyond all bounds by his perfect
sangfroid, she said:</p>

<p>“Shall I tell you why you are no
gentleman?”</p>

<p>“If it will not be giving you too much
trouble,” carefully nursing a newly-lighted
match.</p>

<p>“Because you have told Geoffrey. You
heard what he said just now?”</p>

<p>“Told Geoffrey!” he exclaimed in much
amazement. “Pray explain yourself. You
are speaking in riddles, as far as I’m
concerned.”</p>

<p>“Told him about the other evening—before
the races; it was too shameful. Oh,
you might have spared me!” covering her
face with her hands.</p>

<p>A dead silence. At last his answer came
in a cold formal voice.</p>

<p>“If I had done what you imagine, I
certainly would richly deserve to forfeit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
the name of gentleman. I am surprised
that even you” (with scathing emphasis)
“should ask me to vindicate myself from
such a charge. I have not told Geoffrey—strange
as it may appear to you—and am
sorry that after <i>all</i> you should have such
a mean opinion of me still.”</p>

<p>Alice removed her hands, but averted her
face as she said:</p>

<p>“You did not tell him? Then what
could he mean?”—hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Am I responsible for Geoffrey’s random
remarks?” he asked sarcastically.</p>

<p>“No, no, of course not. Please forgive
me, Reginald; I did you a great injustice!”
looking at him with lovely deprecating eyes.
“Do?” she pleaded.</p>

<p>“You know very well, Alice,” he answered
earnestly, “that I could forgive you anything.
You have only to ask, and it is
granted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>“Surely,” he thought to himself, “this is
a broad hint with a vengeance.”</p>

<p>“A mere <i>façon de parler</i>,” said Alice to
herself; “a kind of Chinese compliment!
Forgive anything! A likely thing, when
my one fault still remains a huge unerasable
blot in his eyes.”</p>

<p>After a moment’s silence she turned
towards him with a pretty little shiver.</p>

<p>“Are you cold?” he asked formally.
(Oh, why will she not seize this blessed
opportunity?)</p>

<p>“No, not actually cold. I believe it’s
a goose walking over my grave—you know
the tradition,” she answered with a laugh.
“Well,” as he remained silent, “if you
are not going to say ‘Happy goose,’ like
the young man in <i>Punch</i>, perhaps you
will be so kind as to bring me my red
shawl; it’s on one of the chairs in the
hall.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>So much for his hints and hopes.</p>

<p>Wrapped in the shawl, as a preventive
against further shivering, Alice and her
husband promenade up and down the terrace
for nearly an hour, although it seemed to
them no longer than a quarter of the time,
talking of India chiefly. He told her about
his regiment, his friends, his horses and
dogs, his native servants, delighted to share
his thoughts and experiences with her who
was, in spite of everything, dearer to him
than life itself. The interest she manifested
made him talk of himself more freely than
he had done for years, and then with her
alone. To her eager questions about the
African campaign—his glories, his decorations,
and his wounds—his answers were
but brief and unsatisfactory; but he dwelt
on the successes of his comrades-in-arms
with generous and eloquent enthusiasm.
And Alice, glad that he should talk to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
as of old, on any subject, and hardly able to
realise the present brief happy moment, lent
a greedy ear to whatever narrative he was
pleased to relate.</p>

<p>So absorbed were they that the other couple
arrived at the foot of the steps unnoticed.</p>

<p>“Rex,” cried Geoffrey, “is she cool?
Is it safe for me to come up?”</p>

<p>“Quite safe. She accords you a free
pardon.”</p>

<p>“Reginald!” she exclaimed, “how <i>can</i>
you say so?”</p>

<p>“You are bound to forgive him; I forgave
that old lady for you the other day—you
owe me a free pardon for Geoffrey.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but that was different. She—she——”</p>

<p>“She did not want to kiss him, did
she?” put in Geoffrey the irrepressible.
“He never would have forgiven <i>that</i>, be
sure!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>When the ladies had gone to bed,
Reginald took a turn up and down the
terrace, solus: “I cannot make her out,”
he said to himself as he knocked the ashes
off his cheroot. “At times, such as this
evening for instance, I could almost imagine
that the past was a bad dream, nothing
more. It’s a curious thing that my own
wife is the only woman who has ever
puzzled me. One day she says we are to
be strangers, the next friends; one day
a cool shake hands, another a kiss. We
spent an hour in a fool’s paradise to-night—at
any rate I did. I would be an idiot
indeed if I took it for the real thing I
seemed so sure of once—paradise without
the fool.”</p>

</div>


<p>The next day was Sunday, and all the
party went to church together in the
open carriage. Alice, in a lovely white
bonnet, a mass of ostrich feathers, sat
opposite to Geoffrey, who, after carefully
inspecting her, patronisingly remarked:</p>

<p>“That is a most touching construction
on your head, Alice, and <i>not</i> unbecoming.
Have yourself painted for the next
Academy, ‘Lady in a Bonnet.’”</p>

<p>“How ridiculous! Fancy <i>me</i> in the
Royal Academy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“Why not? Are you above it, like the
old lady who said ‘she would not mind
being painted for the Academy, but would
wait till she went to Rome and have
herself done by one of <i>the old masters</i>.’”</p>

<p>“I believe you spend your time making
up these stories, Geoffrey. Here we are—now
hand me down nicely; don’t haul me
out as you generally do.”</p>

<p>“You want to show off your new boots;
I know your vanity,” he retorted as he
sprang out.</p>

<p>The church being central was fuller than
most country churches, and attended by
many of the county families. As the
Monkswood party walked up the aisle
every eye was turned on them with
unconcealed curiosity. With Lady Fairfax’s
appearance all were familiar, but
which of these two young men was the
roving husband? “The elder of the two,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
of course; he was dark and bronzed, and
looked like a soldier; the other was a
youth.” N.B.—Geoffrey, although three-and-twenty,
looked about nineteen.</p>

<p>The Fairfaxes formed a topic of discourse
at many a luncheon-table that day.</p>

<p>“Did you see Lady Fairfax in church,
and her husband?” said one young lady.</p>

<p>“How do you know which was her husband,
or if he was there at all?” replied
her mother, who, with bonnet-strings thrown
back, was making an ample meal. “I don’t
believe he has come back one bit.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but he has,” persisted her daughter;
“their coachman told Brown; he arrived
last Monday, and that was him sitting
next the door.”</p>

<p>“Pray how do you know?”</p>

<p>“Because he found the hymns for her,
and gave her a hassock.”</p>

<p>“Weighty reasons certainly. It is much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
more likely, from what you say, that he is
<i>not</i> her husband. You never see your father
finding my place or giving me a footstool,”
returned the old lady, as she tossed off a
glass of sherry and looked round as much
as to say, “This argument is a clincher.”</p>

<p>“Well, but when the offertory-bag came
round I saw her get very red, as if she
had forgotten her purse, and he slipped a
sovereign into her hand.”</p>

<p>“And that’s conclusive, you think?” said
her mother.</p>

<p>“Pray may I inquire how you saw all
this byplay?” asked her brother.</p>

<p>“I was sitting right behind them, and
made good use of my eyes, as usual—that’s
all.”</p>

<p>“Well,” responded the youth, pushing
away his plate, “I don’t care who he is,
but I should like to know who his tailor
is. He was uncommonly well got up. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
never saw a better-built coat,” he added
with fervour.</p>

<p>“I expect the block had something to
say to it. It might not look so well on
shoulders like a champagne-bottle,” returned
his sister, looking at him amiably.</p>

<p>Leaving them to the impending battle,
we return to Monkswood, and find our
friends also at luncheon.</p>

<p>“What disgraceful singing! I never heard
a less unanimous choir; everyone for himself
it seemed to me, time and tune being
quite beneath notice,” remarked Geoffrey.</p>

<p>“It is splendid to what it used to be
when I was a boy,” replied Sir Reginald;
“we had a kind of orchestra composed of
a fiddle and a flute.”</p>

<p>“Did any of you see me?” asked Alice,
appealing to the company. “Every time I
knelt down and leant forward the jet fringe
on the jacket of the lady in front, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
would sit bolt upright, became entangled in
the feathers of my bonnet. At one time it
threatened to be quite serious. I was afraid
I should have had to have slipped off my
bonnet and left it behind.”</p>

<p>“No, I did not remark you,” responded
Geoffrey. “But did you see the old buffer
with the white waistcoat exactly under
the pulpit? Miss Ferrars has taken such
a fancy to him. She never took her
eyes off him, and whispered to me during
the sermon, ‘That she would rather be
an old man’s darling than a young man’s
slave.’”</p>

<p>“Mr. Saville, how can you?”</p>

<p>“<i>He</i> might not suit,” pursued Geoffrey
unabashed, “but I’ll look out for another
old gentleman for you, very old, very
infirm, and very rich—the most tender and
assiduous care during his lifetime guaranteed,
<i>n’est-ce pas</i>?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>“I have no intention of marrying at
present, many thanks for your kind
offer.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps you are right,” returned
Geoffrey calmly. “I myself am inclined
to agree with the Frenchman who said,
‘Three weeks’ paradise, thirty years’ war!’
Married people always fight either quietly
at home, which is the most <i>deadly</i>, or
publicly, which is the most amusing.”</p>

<p>“Really, Geoffrey,” said Miss Saville,
“with two married people present it is
hardly polite to air such opinions.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” replied this incorrigible young
man, looking mischievously at Alice, “if
the cap does not fit them they need not
put it on.”</p>

<p>“Have some claret, Alice?” interrupted
her husband, seeing that Geoffrey was in
a teasing humour.</p>

<p>“No, thank you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, but you will have to take it, my
dear girl,” said her aunt; “you know
you were ordered it.”</p>

<p>“Was she?” exclaimed Sir Reginald,
pouring out a glass and gently pushing
it towards her.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I really cannot drink it. I
hate it!” she urged.</p>

<p>“Then have some on your handkerchief,”
said Geoffrey soothingly; “like the
man who became a teetotaller after indulging
for years, and being asked to take
some <i>real</i> ‘mountain dew,’ reluctantly declined,
but said, ‘Give me a drop on my
handkerchief, it will do me good to <i>smell</i>
it.’”</p>

<p>“Hold out your handkerchief; it will
be all the same as if you swallowed it.”</p>

<p>“Geoffrey, I declare I think you are
quite off your head at times; is he not,
Mary?—or is it his Irish proclivities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
breaking out?” said Alice, waving away
Geoffrey and the claret-jug.</p>

<p>“Don’t <i>you</i> talk about Irish proclivities,
ma’am; you have a strong suspicion of
the blarney-stone yourself, and Irish eyes,
and a real Irish temper.”</p>

<p>“Geoffrey, how <i>can</i> you say so?”</p>

<p>“Very easily. I often see you blarneying
and wheedling that child of yours as
only an Irishwoman can. I suppose you
don’t say, ‘Ah, won’t you now, just to
please mother?’ and you coaxed and talked
me out of that photo of——”</p>

<p>“Geoffrey, I declare, if you say another
word, I’ll never be friends with you again!”
exclaimed Alice, half rising.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right, I’m dumb; but you <i>did</i>,
you know; and I maintain that your
Irishisms are as thick as the leaves in
Vallambrosa. Why should the leaves be
thicker <i>there</i> than anywhere else?” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
he, standing up and looking round. “Can
anyone tell me? I thought not. Well,
I’m off, not to study the leaves, but the
<i>fruit</i> in the garden.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>On Sunday evening, just as Alice was
about to step into bed, and Mary was
already sound asleep, the nurse came in
to say, “Master Maurice is very bad
with croup, and such a time to have it,
too—not a drop of ipecacuanha in the house
since Mary the housemaid broke the bottle
last week.” To hurry on her dressing-gown
and run up to the nursery took Alice
less than two minutes. Maurice lay gasping
in his cot. He was very ill indeed,
as the nurse had said. He had never had
such a bad attack before. His plaintive
eyes, his poor little hot clasping hands,
his struggles for breath, drove Alice nearly
wild.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>The nurse said, “I can’t leave the child,
ma’am. Will you go down and rouse Sir
Reginald or Master Geoffrey, and send off
for the doctor at once?”</p>

<p>Alice flew down the passage, and had
gone some distance before she suddenly
remembered that she did not know which
was her husband’s room, and he must be
called up in preference to Geoffrey. She
knew it was in the old wing, and that
no one but himself slept there. Opening
the swing-door into the dark carpetless
corridor, she tried the first room. Silence.
She opened the door—all was dark and
still; in the next equal blackness and
stillness; at the third, her patience exhausted,
she dispensed with a knock, turned
the handle, and all but fell down the steps
into a lighted room, large, low, and old-fashioned,
bare of curtains and all luxuries.
A small iron bed, some obsolete chairs and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
tables, a huge bookcase, and a couple of
cabinets containing birds’-nests and fossils,
were ranged round the walls. Her husband
was standing in the middle of the
room with his coat off, winding up his
watch. Shutting it with a sharp click, he
viewed the apparition on the doorstep with
unmeasured astonishment. His wife’s white
frightened face told him that something
was amiss, as she stood before him pale
and distracted.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” he cried.
“Robbers! or is the house on fire?”</p>

<p>“Maurice is very ill. I want you to
rouse up the men and send for the
doctor.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” he replied, resuming his
coat and taking up his candle. “I’ll have
a look at him first; perhaps he is not as
bad as you imagine.”</p>

<p>He followed Alice to the nursery; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
when he saw the state of the case he looked
very grave indeed.</p>

<p>“Shall I go for the doctor myself,
Alice?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, sir, <i>do not</i>,” interposed the nurse
significantly. “You had much better stay
here.”</p>

<p>Whilst he was below giving directions,
Alice and the nurse administered a steaming
hot bath to Maurice; but it was of
no avail, his breathing was as laboured
as ever. The nurse going downstairs, on
an errand, met her master returning.</p>

<p>“Well, is he better?” he asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>“No, sir; but worse! How long will
it be before the doctor comes?”</p>

<p>“An hour, at the least,” replied Sir
Reginald.</p>

<p>“An hour’s the very most he will last,
poor lamb.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>“Is he so very bad as all <i>that</i>?” inquired
her master, turning deadly pale.</p>

<p>“Very bad. He could not be worse!
Will you please to stay with my lady
whilst I am away—if anything do happen
to the child, she’ll go clean out of her
mind, for certain—it’s a terrible pity Mrs.
Mayhew is away, and Miss Saville is no
more use than a child herself.”</p>

<p>“Shall I have her called? Surely she
has some experience.”</p>

<p>“No, sir; the fewer people in the
nursery the better; and I’m afraid that
all the experience in the country could not
save the child <i>now</i>—he’s desperate bad.”
So saying, this Job’s comforter continued
her way downstairs, leaving Sir Reginald
to take her place with his wife. He
stood for a moment to collect his thoughts,
and then quickly ascended to the nursery,
where he found the child on Alice’s lap,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
fighting and gasping for breath—a most
heartrending sight. His mother, perfectly
collected so far, but as white as marble,
was soothing him with such soft endearments
and caresses as only a mother
knows.</p>

<p>When her husband entered, she raised
her sweet pathetic eyes to his, as if in
mute entreaty for help for her child.</p>

<p>“I wish I knew something to suggest,
Alice,” he said, coming over to the table,
near which she was sitting; “I am a
capital nurse if it were typhoid fever or
broken bones; but I know nothing about
children. There is an old book on household
medicine in the library, we might
find some hints in it. Shall I fetch
it?”</p>

<p>“Do, and don’t be long,” she answered.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he had returned with
the book, over which they pored together—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
barrier between them was completely
broken down for the time being by this
common anxiety. Alice found herself
ordering him hither and thither as if he
were Geoffrey. None of the remedies
suggested were of any use, as there was
no medicine-chest in the house, and a
mustard plaster and hot bath had been
already tried in vain.</p>

<p>Reginald lifted the child from Alice’s
arms and laid him in his bed, saying that
he would have more air.</p>

<p>Presently the nurse returned, and, standing
at the foot of the cot, surveyed the
little patient critically. Whilst Alice was
bending over him, she approached her
master and whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>“It is all over with him; another fit
like the last and he will choke; he can’t
live above a quarter of an hour.”</p>

<p>“In that case you had better leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
me alone with Lady Fairfax; but bring
the doctor the instant he comes.”</p>

<p>“But I’d better stay, sir; I had, indeed.”</p>

<p>“No—no,” he returned impatiently, “go—go
at once. You can be of no use
here.”</p>

<p>This whispered conversation was unnoticed
by Alice, who was bending over
Maurice, fanning him. With watch in
hand, Sir Reginald stood at one side of
the child, whilst his wife knelt at the other.
Maurice seemed weaker and weaker.</p>

<p>Alice looked at her husband and read in
his face that he shared her worst fears.
Her child was dying. She leant over her
boy in an agony of tearless grief.</p>

<p>“Oh, my darling Maurice!” she cried
almost frantically, “don’t die, don’t leave
me! you are all I have in the world!”
looking at him with distracted eyes and
wringing her small thin hands. “If you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
are taken I will go with you. I won’t,
no, I won’t live without you!”</p>

<p>“Alice, Alice!” remonstrated her husband;
“think of what you are saying.”</p>

<p>Suddenly rising, she took the child up
in her arms and carried him to the
window.</p>

<p>“At least he shall die in my arms,”
she said. “Yes, he shall!” she exclaimed
excitedly.</p>

<p>“But he is not dying now,” said Sir
Reginald. “Give him to me for a little;
he is much too heavy for you. Remember,
whilst there’s life there’s hope.”</p>

<p>“No—no—no! Do not take him from
me for the little time he may be left.
Oh, my own darling, how you are suffering!
If I could only bear it for you; if
I might only die in your stead!” she
moaned, rocking the boy in her arms.
“How glad I am that they say I am so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
weak and delicate; I will soon follow
you, my treasure.”</p>

<p>Sir Reginald, leaning against the window-shutter,
listened to his half-distracted wife
in silence.</p>

<p>“I know you think that I am wicked,
that I am insane,” continued Alice; “but
if he dies I will die too; it will kill me.”
And she turned on him a look akin to
madness and despair.</p>

<p>“Alice, am I nothing to you, then?”</p>

<p>“You! You are only the shadow of
my husband. No; you are nothing to
me; you said so yourself,” she murmured
as she kissed her boy’s hands convulsively.</p>

<p>“I know that I am nothing to you
but the shadow of a husband. Deeply
as you have injured me, what else could
I be? But consider me now—for the
next few hours at least—the husband I
<i>would</i> have been to you, and let me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
comfort you, my dearest. If your child
is taken, who can share your grief like
me—his father? and if he is spared—as
I sincerely trust he will be—who can so
deeply feel the happiness of having him
restored? His pulse is still pretty strong,”
he added, taking the child’s little hand in
his. “The doctor will be here in five
minutes. Do not give up all hope yet,
my poor Alice.”</p>

<p>“Oh Reginald,” she said gratefully,
“you have lifted a little of the load off
my heart; you have comforted me already.”</p>

<p>At this instant the door opened, and
the doctor and nurse came into the room;
the former bustled over to the side of
Maurice’s cot.</p>

<p>“Ah-h!” said he. He always prefaced
his remarks with a long breath, as if he
had just swallowed something delicious.
“I’m in time, after all, I see! Bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
him here to the table, Lady Fairfax, and
I’ll give him a dose that will cure him in
no time. Don’t look so frightened, my
dear young lady.”</p>

<p>White as her dressing-gown, her long
hair hanging in a thick loose plait far
below her waist, she rose and gave her boy
into the doctor’s hands. He administered a
remedy that had an almost instantaneous
effect, and, within a quarter of an hour,
Maurice lay in his little cot sound
asleep.</p>

<p>The doctor, an elderly, eccentric, and
extremely clever man, after staring at Sir
Reginald for some seconds, said brusquely:</p>

<p>“And who is this young gentleman who
has dropped the medicine so accurately
and been so useful?”</p>

<p>“He is my husband, Dr. Barton.”</p>

<p>“Ah-h! I thought so, from the likeness
to the boy; but you told me your husband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
was in India! By what conjuring trick is
he here to-night?”</p>

<p>“No conjuring trick beyond a medical
board,” replied Sir Reginald coolly.</p>

<p>“Ah-h! Well, as you <i>are</i> here, Sir
Reginald, I want to speak to you. The
child is all right, there is not the slightest
fear of him—a bad attack of croup; but
I’ve pulled children through worse often.
That idiot of a nurse, to swell her own
importance, seems to have frightened Lady
Fairfax nearly into fits. I never thought
much of that nurse—never; I often told
you so,” nodding solemnly at Alice. “Well,
we may as well go downstairs, Sir Reginald.
Good-night, Lady Fairfax; good-night, and
go to bed.”</p>

<p>Together they descended to the library.
The doctor, having usurped the rug and
refreshed himself with some spirits and
water, said abruptly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>“I want particularly to speak to you,
Sir Reginald, now you <i>are</i> here, about
your wife. The boy is all right, he will
live to plague you for many a year; he is
as strong as a pony; there’s no fear of
<i>him</i>.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean,” said Sir Reginald, fixing
on him an eye piercing as an eagle’s, “that
there <i>is</i> fear of my wife?”</p>

<p>“I do,” he replied emphatically, “and I
think it my duty to tell you so, now you
<i>are</i> here. That you set off to India and
left a delicate girl of seventeen moping
here alone is your concern, of course!”</p>

<p>“Of course,” repeated his host, reddening
with anger.</p>

<p>Dr. Barton eyed the young man standing
before him with a resentful glance from
under his bushy, luxuriant, gray eyebrows.</p>

<p>“He looks overbearing, harsh, and cold.
I’ve no doubt he treats her as he treats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
his troopers; I’ll not spare him then.
Your wife,” clearing his throat and speaking
slowly, “will probably leave you a
widower ere long. She comes of a delicate
stock, and, as far as I can observe, is rapidly
following in her mother’s footsteps.”</p>

<p>Seeing that this thrust told, he continued:</p>

<p>“She is subject to deadly fainting fits,
and might go off in one of them any day.”</p>

<p>A dead silence followed this remark,
during which the doctor, after glaring at
Sir Reginald over the edge of his tumbler,
swallowed the remainder of his whisky
and water, and, buttoning up his coat and
taking his hat, briskly prepared to depart.</p>

<p>Sir Reginald’s dry lips refused to speak;
large drops of perspiration stood like beads
on his brow; the veins in his hand, where
he was grasping the back of a chair,
resembled thick cords.</p>

<p>“Ah,” thought the doctor, complacently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
“he does care. However, he had no business
to leave her,” he said to himself, as
he feasted his eye on his victim with an
air of tranquil enjoyment.</p>

<p>“She may,” he proceeded aloud, “come
round with care and indulgence of every
kind; she must never be crossed, thwarted,
or agitated, and always have her own way.
(Looks as if he liked his own way.) I’ll
come round in a day or two and see how
she is going on. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Wait a second,” said Sir Reginald
vehemently, detaining him with one hand;
“you cannot go like this. If my wife is
so seriously ill, you must leave me some
more fixed directions.”</p>

<p>“She is not actually ill, only threatened
with illness. As for directions, I say watch
her and guard her as the very apple of your
eye. She nearly died when that child was
born, as I daresay you know. A sudden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
chill, a bad cold, would carry her off; she
has no stamina.” Exit.</p>

<p>“What a night this has been,” thought
Sir Reginald, looking at the clock wearily;
“first I am told that the child is dying,
now my wife.”</p>

<p>He drew a chair to the table, and, leaning
his elbows on it, buried his face in his
hands.</p>

<p>“Anything but <i>this</i>,” he said to himself;
“after all I have gone through can <i>this</i> be
coming?”</p>

<p>For more than a quarter of an hour he
remained in the same attitude, wrestling
with the bitterest anguish he had ever
known. The door, which was ajar, was
softly pushed open and Alice came in.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, “what does he say; is
it all right?”</p>

<p>Then catching sight of her husband’s face,
she seized his arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>“Tell me the worst at once,” she gasped,
steadying herself by her other hand on the
back of his chair. “Don’t hide it from me,
for God’s sake!”</p>

<p>“There is nothing to be told,” he replied,
making a valiant effort to speak and look as
usual. “Maurice was not nearly as ill as we
imagined; he will be all right to-morrow;
I assure you there is no cause for alarm,”
he added earnestly, “none whatever.”</p>

<p>“You are sure? You are not saying
this out of mistaken kindness? It is
true?”</p>

<p>“Quite true,” he repeated, pushing back
his chair and standing up.</p>

<p>Alice gazed fixedly at her husband; he
was deathly pale, and had a half-stunned
look, and surely when she first saw him
his thick black lashes were <i>wet</i>.</p>

<p>“Then what was the matter with you
just now?” she inquired. “Won’t you tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
me? Won’t you let me share your trouble
after all you said to-night?”</p>

<p>“I can’t. At least not now,” he
stammered.</p>

<p>“Why not now?” she exclaimed. “It
must be some very bad news, I know, for
you look even more sorry than when we
thought Maurice was dying; and yet it
<i>cannot</i> be anything worse than that! Let
me help you to bear it whatever it is; do,
my dear Regy?”</p>

<p>“Never allude to the subject again, Alice,
unless you wish to drive me frantic. You
could not share this trouble with me, no one
could. Perhaps some day I may tell you,
not now. You must go to bed at once, it
is past two o’clock,” he added authoritatively.</p>

<p>“No, no,” she replied firmly; “I am
going to sit up with Maurice.”</p>

<p>“Indeed you will do nothing of the kind;
I will stay with him if it is necessary; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
you are to go to bed this instant,” he replied
in a tone that effectually repelled argument.
And in spite of all Alice could say she was
obliged to obey, and, very reluctantly,
retired.</p>

</div>


<p>Maurice, with a broad piece of flannel
round his throat, appeared at breakfast
next morning as well as ever; and Alice,
pale and languid, took her place before the
teapot as usual. She observed a change in
her husband. On other mornings he disappeared
after breakfast, and was never
seen till luncheon, excusing himself on the
plea of business with the bailiff; and, in
fact, unless absolutely obliged to ride or
play lawn-tennis, they saw nothing of him
all day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>Alice had reason to know that many
of his spare hours were spent with Maurice.
More than once she had come across the
pair in the park, Maurice riding Tweedle
Dum, his father holding the bridle and
relating long and thrilling fairy tales—accounts
of dwarfs, giants, and fairy-princesses
with golden hair; or they would
be discovered on the edge of a pond,
sailing boats, or under the lee of a haycock,
sharing a leaf of strawberries.
Maurice idolised his father, and Alice
could see that she no longer had the first
and only place in his affections. She felt
no twinge of jealousy as she made this
discovery; she was very ready to share
his heart with Reginald.</p>

<p>This particular morning her husband
did not vanish as usual the instant breakfast
was over. He loitered about the
grounds with the ladies, made suggestions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
about the garden, and gave them a lesson
in budding roses.</p>

<p>He distinctly put a veto on lawn-tennis
as far as Alice was concerned, but he
fetched a chair, a book, and a shawl, and
established her under a tree, where she
could look on. She caught his eyes fixed
on her more than once with a look of
anxiety and concern in their dark depths
that puzzled her extremely.</p>

<p>What did this change mean? Could he
be going to forgive her after all? Her
colour and her spirits rose at the thought;
a little happiness goes a long way at
twenty. Revived by a whole morning’s
rest, she was meditating a move, when
Geoffrey, with a broad smirk on his face
and a fat frog in his handkerchief, lounged
up to her.</p>

<p>“Here,” said he, “is the frog who would
a-wooing go;” and he added, as he uncovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
the treasure, “he is come to pay
his addresses to you, Alice,” making a feint
of putting him in her lap.</p>

<p>“That he is not,” she cried, jumping up
and dodging Geoffrey round a tree. Round
and round they went like a pair of squirrels,
Mary and Reginald gravely looking on.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see such a pair of
children?” exclaimed Mary. “That’s the
way Alice used to go on before she was
married. She had such wild spirits; she
was the life of us all at Rougemont. I
would never have known her to be the
same person, she is so changed,” she
observed, with a reproachful glance at
Reginald.</p>

<p>“I see you blame me for it all, Miss
Ferrars; but Alice has only herself to
thank, no one else. You would say that
I was changed too if you had known me
three years ago, before this unfortunate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
separation between us. Alice has told you
all about it, of course?” he asked with
conviction.</p>

<p>“No, not one word.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that, living together
in such close intimacy—sharing the same
room, and no doubt sitting up half the
night talking, as young ladies do—she has
never made you her confidante?”</p>

<p>“Not with regard to you. On any other
subject she is as open as the day, but her
married life she never alludes to; and well
as I know her and love her—childish and
young as she is—she is the last person into
whose confidence I would thrust myself
uninvited.”</p>

<p>Just at this instant Alice, who had
hitherto eluded Geoffrey, came running up
exhausted and out of breath with laughing.</p>

<p>“Save me, Mary, save me!” she cried,
stretching out both hands, and at the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
time catching her foot in the tennis-rope she
would have measured her length on the
sward, had not her husband stepped forward
and caught her in his arms. It was altogether
accidental, and only for a second that
he held her, but Alice became crimson.</p>

<p>“I cannot allow any more of this kind of
thing,” he said, coolly picking up his tennis-bat.
“Helen will be back this afternoon, and
I am sure she will not hear of your going to
the ball to-morrow if you knock yourself up
to-day. I am going into Manister now,
and I leave you in Miss Ferrars’ charge. I
see Cardigan waiting, and as I have to
change my clothes I must be off.”</p>

<p>“By-the-way, Rex, before you go I want
you to tell me something,” said Geoffrey
with an air of unusual solemnity.</p>

<p>“Yes?” responded Reginald, turning back
and looking at him gravely. “Look sharp,
then, for I’m in a hurry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>“You have been brought up amongst
horses since you were the size of Maurice,
and ought to know all about them, both
from a civil and military point of view——”</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?” impatiently.</p>

<p>“On which side of a horse does the most
hair grow?”</p>

<p>“The side the mane is on.”</p>

<p>“No; try again.”</p>

<p>“The off side!—the near side!”</p>

<p>“No. Give it up?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course I do.”</p>

<p>“The outside! Good riddle, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“No. Your own, I presume. I have
no time to waste listening to such
nonsense. Now mind you don’t encourage
Alice in running about and tiring herself,”
he concluded, as with a glance at his wife
he walked rapidly away.</p>

<p>“What does he mean?” asked Geoffrey
with raised brows and an air of veiled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
derision; “one would think you were made
of sugar! I suppose he is going into Manister
to buy a glass case to keep you in! You
don’t mean to tell me you are about to set
up as a young lady who faints and goes into
hysterics, or a delicate creature with nerves?
If you are, I’ve done with you!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Do not be alarmed; I think I shall
reassure you at luncheon. I have the
appetite of a ploughman, and I am yearning
for the gong,” replied Alice as, shouldering
her parasol, she turned towards the house,
followed by her two friends.</p>

<p>Helen arrived the same afternoon and
related her adventures and news at five-o’clock
tea. She also delivered a short
but severe lecture to Alice for having
taken a long ride, and looking pale, heavy-eyed,
and tired. In spite of Alice’s indignant
denial she could not conceal from
herself that she <i>was</i> very tired as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
entered the drawing-room just before
dinner and wearily seated herself in one
of the windows. The only other occupant
of the room was her husband, ensconced
in an easy-chair and almost concealed by
a large newspaper. She recognised him,
however, by the slim brown hand that
firmly grasped <i>The Standard</i>. He did
not take any notice of her entrance. “He
never did,” she thought with a sharp pang
as she leant her head listlessly against the
window-sash and looked out. Suddenly
the grass appeared to heave, earth and sky
seemed confusedly mixed. She turned her
head, the room was swimming round and
round; she was going to faint. She rose to
escape to her own room whilst there was
yet time, but it was too late; she tottered,
grasped blindly at a chair; somebody, tall
and strong, took her in his arms, and she
remembered no more. Reginald had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
surreptitiously glancing at Alice for some
minutes. Her dejected attitude, the weary
pathetic pose of her haughty little head,
struck him painfully. How white, how
awfully white she was; was she going to
faint? She was; he saw her rise unsteadily
and try to speak. In an instant he was
beside her, and saved her from a fall for
the second time that day. Very, very
tenderly he carried her over and laid her
on a couch. How light and fragile was
his burden—she seemed like a child in his
arms! She looked deathlike as he laid
her down. He had never seen a woman
faint before, and was at his wits’ end to
know what to do. To leave her was impossible;
he dare not. He rang the bell madly
and returned to his post. As he thought
of the doctor’s words the previous evening
his heart stood still with horror. She
looked so cold, so marblelike, so utterly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
inanimate—could she be dead? He took
up one of her small limp hands and felt
her pulse. As he was doing so, Helen and
Mary, to his great relief, came into the
room.</p>

<p>“Ah, I’m not one bit surprised,” said the
former composedly. “Run for my salts,
Mary. Fetch a glass of water and a fan,
Regy. She will come round presently.”</p>

<p>Her quiet matter-of-fact manner relieved
him at once. Mary’s mind was set at rest
now and for ever on one subject—Sir
Reginald did care for Alice after all:
loved her as a man like him could love.</p>

<p>One glance at him had been sufficient.
Even now, though reassured by Helen,
his face was ashy white, and the hand
that held the tumbler of water shook
visibly. By this time they were joined
by Mark and Geoffrey. Alice had revived;
she sat up, looking very pale and dazed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
and announced “that she was all right
and going in to dinner, and really did
not know how she could have been so
stupid.”</p>

<p>She was quickly suppressed by Helen,
who said:</p>

<p>“No, my dear, no dinner for you; you
are going to bed, and Regy will carry
you upstairs.”</p>

<p>“Indeed he shall not!” cried Alice, a
faint tinge of pink coming into her cheeks,
and starting up as though to leave the
sofa. “No, no,” she added, glancing
nervously at her husband; his grave,
anxious face touched her and surprised
her.</p>

<p>“Will you let Mark carry you?” said
Helen soothingly. “He has had plenty
of practice with me, and he won’t drop
you.”</p>

<p>“No, ten thousand times; why should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
anyone carry me? I’ve not lost the use
of my limbs; I am quite capable of walking
upstairs. I shall stay here for the present,
whilst you all go to dinner. Pray go!
Please go! Don’t mind me. Helen will
tell you,” addressing her husband, “that
it is nothing—nothing at all. Why, at
one time I used to faint regularly every
day—I got quite into the habit of it,”
with a reassuring smile. “There is the
gong. You really make me very uncomfortable
all of you, staring at me like this.
Go,” she added, waving them away, “go
to dinner.”</p>

<p>Thus eagerly adjured they trooped off,
with the exception of Helen. Mary observed
that one person barely touched a morsel
of food, and that was Reginald. He was
silent and preoccupied, and answered at
random when addressed.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of the meal Helen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
came sailing into the room, prepared to
make up for lost time as she briskly
unfolded her napkin.</p>

<p>“You may make your mind quite easy,
Regy,” she said. “Alice will be all right
to-morrow. She was only worn out, poor
child, and has gone to bed, and is, I daresay,
already asleep. How frightened you
did look! What would have become of
you if you had seen her when she was
really ill, and her life hung by a thread
from hour to hour?” she added between
two spoonsful of soup.</p>

<p>“How do you know I was frightened?”</p>

<p>“Your face spoke volumes, my dear boy;
you were as white as this tablecloth.”</p>

<p>“Is that how you look when you go
into action, Regy?” asked Geoffrey, looking
up from his plate.</p>

<p>“Scarcely, I hope, or I would be a sorry
example to the men.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>“Tell me, Rex, did you ever know
what it was to be in a regular blue
funk?”</p>

<p>“I can’t honestly say I ever was on my
own account—probably it’s a treat in
store for me—but I have felt fears for
others that have made my heart stand
still more than once. The sensation must
be the same as abject personal fear—in
other words, a blue funk.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t understand; explain yourself?”</p>

<p>“For instance, when I saw a gun and
four horses suddenly back over the edge
of a pass, and ultimately go over—in spite
of the horses’ frantic exertions—a fall of
two thousand feet, I trembled for the
gunners.”</p>

<p>“So I should imagine.”</p>

<p>“Fortunately they flung themselves off
in time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>“Poor horses! what a horrible sight!”
said Mary Ferrars. “I daresay you have
seen a good many such.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m sorry to say I have. For
instance, I have seen a horse’s head taken
clean off with a shell.”</p>

<p>“Don’t, Reginald!” exclaimed Helen;
“you are making me perfectly sick.”</p>

<p>“Well then, I won’t; I’ll spare you the
rest of my experiences. You want to
know, Geoff, what I mean by ‘fearing for
others’? Now, for instance, if old Fordyce
gets the regiment, I tremble for <i>you</i>. He has
seen the superb caricature you drew of him,
nearly all nose; and he strongly suspects
that you are the ‘party’ that painted old
Blowhard, his favourite white charger, a
dazzling shepherd’s-plaid. I shudder when
I think of <i>your</i> fate, my young friend.”</p>

<p>“Stuff, rubbish, nonsense!” exclaimed
Geoffrey contemptuously. “Do you know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
what <i>I</i> heard the other day? but I need
hardly say that I did not believe it: that
you, Reginald Fairfax,—‘Fighting Fairfax,’
as they call you—keep the young fry of the
Seventeenth in glorious order. ‘Set a thief to
catch a thief,’ I said. The benighted youths
look upon you as a happy blending of
Bayard and Sir Galahad. I assured my
informant that ‘Still waters run deep’ was
a proverb made expressly to fit you, and
that they little knew you.”</p>

<p>“Much obliged,” replied Reginald, stroking
his moustache to conceal a smile. “We
have a very nice set of boys in the
Seventeenth, and you might do worse
than exchange. I’ll see that they don’t
bully you, and do what I can to smarten
you up.”</p>

<p>“Thanks for your noble offer, but the
Fifth could not afford to lose me. As to
smartening me up, it would be impossible;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
it would be painting the lily. Don’t you
think so, Miss Ferrars? Don’t you think
I’m a very smart-looking young fellow? just
as efficient, if not actually as bloodthirsty,
as our host, who revelled in the name of
‘Shaitan’ whilst in Afghanistan. It was
a pretty little nickname given him by the
tribes. You can guess what it means,”
nodding across the table mysteriously.</p>

<p>“Enough of these mutual compliments,”
exclaimed Helen. “It was not Reginald
himself, but his <i>horse</i> that was called
‘Shaitan,’ my good Geoffrey, and the
Afghans had something else to do than
find nicknames for British officers.”</p>

<p>“By-the-way, Rex,” remarked Geoffrey,
leaning back in his chair, adjusting his eye-glass,
and evidently stretching his long
legs still farther under the mahogany, with
the air of a man who has dined to his
satisfaction, “what’s your opinion of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
native of that part of the world, candidly
and impartially?”</p>

<p>“If you mean the Afridi of the period,
my candid, impartial opinion of him is that
he is a dirty-looking ruffian, who would rob
his own mother, and cut his father’s throat
for the sake of two rupees.”</p>

<p>“Inhuman monster!” ejaculated Helen,
tragically.</p>

<p>“One old fellow told me <i>himself</i> that
there was nothing in life so pleasant as
sitting on the roof of one’s house, and
shooting at the wayfarers who came to
drink at the well. He dwelt on the subject
with such pleasure, that I have no doubt
that he looked back on it as one of his
happiest experiences.”</p>

<p>“Old brute!” muttered Geoffrey. “<i>How</i> I
should have enjoyed a pot-shot at <i>him</i>! What
sort of shots were they, take them all in all?”</p>

<p>“Not bad, considering their weapons and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
ammunition; a long Jazail studded with
brass, and rams’ horns full of very doubtful
powder. They are no use at a snap shot,
or in the open; but give them <i>lots</i> of time
to aim, and good cover behind a bit of rock,
and they generally pick off a fair share of
stragglers. The first night we camped
beyond Ali Musjid we chose a bad place,
a hollow, and the light attracted swarms
all round us. The bullets went everywhere,
and the firing resembled nothing on earth
so much as a hot corner at a big battue.”</p>

<p>“Awfully pleasant for all you fellows!”
ejaculated Geoffrey.</p>

<p>“We had only two casualties, strange
to say, though some of the tents were
riddled. I need scarcely remark that we
were more careful about the site of our
next camp.”</p>

<p>“No doubt you made yourselves very
secure and luxurious when you were permanently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
fixed at Dabaule?” inquired
Helen.</p>

<p>“Comparatively speaking I suppose we
were more secure, although Vaughan caught
an Afridi in his tent one night. He heard a
noise, and putting out his hand to get hold
of a revolver, he caught the bare, shaven
head of one of these beggars. He gave the
alarm, and some of us rushed in and found
him struggling with a powerful fellow, with
the fiend’s own expression and a knife
between his teeth. We made an example
of him next day as a warning to others.
But it was of precious little use; they
slaughtered our unfortunate grass-cutters
and syces in the most barbarous way, and
sent us in our regimental barber with both
hands cut off. He did not seem to mind
<i>that</i> so much as eighty rupees they had
robbed him of, and he was utterly heartbroken
about them—his savings, his little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
all. So I promised to make up the money
if he got well; and, strange to say, he
made a most wonderfully rapid recovery,
and seems to get on capitally with his
two bare stumps.”</p>

<p>“Poor creature!” exclaimed Helen.</p>

<p>“How horrible!” cried Miss Ferrars.</p>

<p>“I suppose it was all open country?”
remarked Geoffrey; “no roads, and like a
bleak sort of common, I always fancy it;
with a few hills and lots of stones and
rocks.”</p>

<p>“That was the case in some places, but
in others we had, after awhile, a capital
road, especially by the Kyber line, thanks
to the sappers; and some wag in one place
put up a finger-post with ‘Madras to Cabul’
painted on it in large letters; and the road
itself was as good as you need wish to see;
but in many parts we had no road at all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
and it was terrible work for the artillery,
especially when the country was cut up
with lots of watercourses.”</p>

<p>“By-the-bye, Rex,” said Helen, helping
herself to her second peach, “how were
you off for food?”</p>

<p>“Very badly, indeed, sometimes; and I
assure you that I now know what <i>hunger</i>
means, from downright practical experience.”</p>

<p>“Why, you had your rations and your
mess,” cried Geoffrey.</p>

<p>“A pound of meat a day for a hungry
man who spends, perhaps, twelve hours in
the saddle, with a bitter bleak wind to
sharpen his appetite, was not much to
boast of; and sometimes the ration was
bad, or bone. When we had our permanent
camp we fared well enough, and had a stew—a
big pot into which everything was
thrown: game, rations, goat, etc.; and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
the pot was always kept going, it had a
rich miscellaneous flavour, difficult to
describe, but most excellent.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that it was not made
afresh every day?” asked Miss Ferrars, a
fair amateur cook.</p>

<p>“Every day something fresh was added,
but the original stew was about three
months old. Never cleared out, that was
the beauty of it.”</p>

<p>“O-oh!” cried Helen, “how could you!
how can you?”</p>

<p>“It was most superior, I assure you;
our <i>pot-au-feu</i> was noted, I can tell you,
Helen.”</p>

<p>“That will do. No more traveller’s tales
for <i>me</i>, Rex”—rising—“I’m going to see
if Alice is asleep.”</p>

<p>As the door closed on the disgusted
matron, Reginald said:</p>

<p>“Helen may turn up her nose at our stew,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
but if she had been one week in camp, she
would have appreciated it just as keenly
as the most ravenous among us.”</p>

<p>“Had you a mess-tent?” asked Geoffrey
solicitously.</p>

<p>“Yes, a kind of one, when we were
fixtures; nothing very luxurious, I need
scarcely say, and little or no mess kit. It
was a sight, once seen never forgotten, to
witness our fellows going to dinner;
various figures in greatcoats and comforters
solemnly approaching, and each bearing
in his hand his own drinking-cup, and
plate, and knife and fork. We lived in
Spartan simplicity, I can assure you.”</p>

<p>“And how did you like it?” inquired
Miss Ferrars.</p>

<p>“To be frank with you, not much,”
returned her host candidly. “The cold
was simply awful—bad enough for us who
come from a coldish climate, but for our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
poor camp-followers and syces, natives of
the broiling plains, it was, in many cases,
death. I could not say how many camel-drivers
and grass-cutters have been found
frozen in their sleep.”</p>

<p>“But they had warm clothes,” said Mrs.
Mayhew, with the air of asserting an
unanswerable fact.</p>

<p>“Yes; such as they were. A kind of
blanket suit made to fit the million. And then
you saw tall men in clothes barely below their
miserable knees, and little men shambling
along, one huge wrinkle. These garments
were better than nothing, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“And did you feel the cold yourself?”
asked Mark, with sympathetic interest.</p>

<p>“Sometimes; but I am a hardy fellow,
and could stand it better than lots of others.
Duck-shooting of a winter’s day, at home,
broke me in pretty well, you know.”</p>

<p>“And was your appetite equally well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
broken in?” asked Geoffrey, with raised
eyebrows.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” returned Reginald,
with a laugh. “Many a time I have gone
to bed hungry.”</p>

<p>“But you could always buy?” said
Geoffrey, combatively.</p>

<p>“Not always. When the surrounding
country was nothing but stones and brown
grass, and there was no bazaar, no
mess, nothing but our strictly allotted
ration, I declare I’ve sometimes envied
my chargers, who were pretty well off
for hay. But of course these short commons
were the exception, not the rule,”
he added cheerfully.</p>

<p>Mary gazed with blank, open-eyed amazement
at her neighbour, and tried to realise
that this nonchalant, handsome host of
hers, who seemed to consider it rather an
exertion to break a few walnuts, who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
surrounded by every luxury taste could
devise or money could obtain, had been
quite recently a cold, hungry soldier, garbed
in a sheepskin coat; had confronted hardship
and war, and had ridden up undaunted
and looked into the very face of death
itself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br><span class="small">THE BALL AT RUFFORD.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The evening of the ball found Alice
arraying herself at her cheval glass, an
admiring Abigail was twitching and pulling
at her dress—she also admired herself in
no small degree. The glass reflected an
exquisitely-fitting white silk ball costume,
trimmed with clouds of soft lace, tulle,
and silver—it was not merely a dress, it
was an inspiration. A thick collar of
diamonds encircled her throat—Reginald’s
wedding present; three diamond stars to
correspond sparkled in her hair; silver and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
diamond bangles, long white gloves, and a
feather fan completed her toilet.</p>

<p>Mary, in pale pink (her particular colour),
looked remarkably well; but Alice <i>killed</i>
her; no one would look at her twice
beside such a dazzling vision of loveliness.</p>

<p>Together they descended to the hall, and
found Mr. and Mrs. Mayhew, Geoffrey, and
Reginald awaiting them, the two latter in
the full splendour of their hussar uniform.
Maurice, who had been allowed to sit up
for once, seemed duly to appreciate the
great occasion, and viewed his father with
profound and unmistakable admiration;
even the radiant apparition in white that
came floating down the staircase was powerless
to divert his attention.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>After an eight-mile drive the Monkswood
party found themselves at the scene
of action, and amidst a throng of carriages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
and blaze of lights descended at the
entrance.</p>

<p>“We shall have to sort ourselves now,”
remarked Geoffrey, as he sprang out with
the bound of a kangaroo. “You and Alice,
Regy—Miss Ferrars and I will follow—lead
the way.”</p>

<p>On a table in the entrance-hall lay heaps
of gilded programmes. Sir Reginald picked
up two as he passed, and, handing one to
his wife, said carelessly:</p>

<p>“You will give me a dance, Alice; won’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” she replied, secretly much
surprised at the request. “I have promised
Geoffrey the second valse; what
will you have?”</p>

<p>“The valse after supper, when the room
is not so crowded. There seem to be
hundreds here,” glancing through the
ball-room. “Let me see,” taking her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
programme and looking at it for an
instant; “Number fourteen, ‘Brises des
Nuits,’ I’ll take that, thanks,” scribbling
his initials and handing back her card.
“We had better move on now, the door is
no longer blocked.”</p>

<p>They at last succeeded in making their
way to Lady Rufford, who received them
with much <i>empressement</i>; and Alice, after
exchanging a few words with her hostess,
was eagerly engaged for the ensuing lancers
by a little Russian prince, who had clamorously
begged for an introduction.</p>

<p>It is almost needless to describe a large
ball in a country house; there is a
strong family likeness among them, one is
very much like another. A good floor,
good supper, Liddell’s band, and flowers in
all directions constitute the chief features.
The house party, the <i>élite</i> of the county,
formed some portion of those present.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
There were pretty country girls with
rather <i>outré</i> dresses; there were stylish
young ladies, who went to town every
season, and wore unimpeachable frocks, to
these a ball was a very ordinary affair;
there were young men, bored and <i>blasé</i>,
lounging against doors and walls, and
looking superior to the whole thing;
rustic sons of neighbouring squires, uncouth
and unpolished, enjoying themselves
hugely in elephantine gambols with the
partners of their choice. There were the
chaperones—already languishing for supper,
a large military contingent, and an immense
number of outsiders, to whom this ball was
the great social event of the year. The
rooms were crowded; the reception-room,
tea-room, and ball-room were almost impassible,
not to speak of the staircase and
all the nooks and corners that were
crammed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>Alice and Reginald were personally but
little known, and they overheard various
remarks about themselves of a highly
laudatory character. For instance, during
a pause in a valse Reginald’s lively
partner, who was freely discussing the
dancers, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Do look at that girl in white, just
opposite. There, standing next the pillar.
How she and that boy are enjoying themselves!
They seem too intimate for you to
call it a flirtation, and not sufficiently tender
for an engaged couple. Who can they be?
I have never seen them before.”</p>

<p>Seeing her partner smile, she added:</p>

<p>“Ah, I believe you know them!”</p>

<p>“I do,” he calmly replied. “The boy,
who would be extremely indignant if he
heard you call him one, is Mr. Saville, of
the Fifth Hussars; and the young lady
with him is his cousin, and my wife.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>“Your wife! you don’t say so? You
are joking! Is that really Lady Fairfax?
She looks so preposterously young, I
could easily imagine this to be her first
ball.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, she has been married for
more than three years.”</p>

<p>“She is uncommonly pretty,” returned the
young lady, gazing at her with all her eyes.
“Several people have asked me who she
was, but I did not know. She is quite the
belle of the evening. Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“I always agree with a lady, especially
when it is a question of taste,” was his
evasive answer. “Shall we take another
turn?”</p>

<p>“Not very <i>enthusiastic</i> about his wife,”
was his partner’s mental observation as
they once more joined the dancers.</p>

<p>“Who is the lovely girl in white?” was
a question that half the room were asking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
each other. Alice is at last obtaining a
<i>social success</i>, dozens of partners vainly
beg for dances. She is turning the heads
of all the young men, and filling the breasts
of her own sex with the devouring flame of
envy.</p>

<p>Supper was served at round tables accommodating
ten or twelve. Sir Reginald and
his partner had taken their places at one at
which he was a stranger to all the other
guests. A fat red-faced man, who was
voraciously gobbling down lobster-salad,
remarked to his neighbours:</p>

<p>“Capital ball! capital supper!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied a bored-looking youth,
with a patronising drawl, “good floor, lots of
pretty girls.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” added a third, helping himself
to ham, “but there is no one that comes
within the length of a street of that girl
in white, Lady Fairfax.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>“Quite agree with you,” responded the
bored one, in a tone of deep approval.</p>

<p>“Could not get a dance, though,” said
another; “card crammed.”</p>

<p>“But,” pleaded his partner, a young
person with a figure and dress resembling
a pink-and-white pin-cushion, “although
she is quite too lovely, she has a melancholy
expression when her face is in repose. I
admire a more <i>riant</i> style. I think Miss
Gordon is more taking, though not so
strictly pretty.”</p>

<p>“I think so too,” said another lady;
“Miss Gordon is <i>my</i> beauty.”</p>

<p>“You are welcome to her, ladies,”
responded the red-faced squire; “none of
the gentlemen will dispute her with you—we
are all sworn admirers of Lady Fairfax.
She’s like a princess—a fairy princess.
Let’s drink her health,” seizing a magnum
of champagne and suiting the action to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
the word, having already supped “not
wisely, but too well.”</p>

<p>Reginald, much disgusted, was tied to
this particular table by his partner’s wants—the
demands of a locust-like appetite.</p>

<p>“Never so tiresome or so hungry a
girl,” he thought, as he replenished her
plate time after time.</p>

<p>“What fun it is to hear them discussing
your wife,” she whispered; “you should
get up and return thanks. How taken
aback they would look.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I will disturb their
equanimity so cruelly,” he returned. “But
if you have <i>quite</i> finished, we will adjourn.
The next dance has commenced, and your
partner is sure to be anathematising me.”</p>

<p>As he rose and left the table, someone
said:</p>

<p>“Who is the young hussar fellow with
the V.C. and the scowl?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>“Walking down the room with the girl
in green?” answered a quiet-looking man,
who had taken the vacant place, and was
critically scanning the <i>menu</i>.</p>

<p>“Yes, the same.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s Fairfax.” (Sensation at the
supper-table.)</p>

<p>Sir Reginald having recovered his liberty,
was on his way to seek for a fresh partner,
when he came face to face with one of the
Twenty-Ninth who had been his host at
Cheetapore. After a few brief expressions
of pleasure and astonishment, the
dragoon asked the hussar where he was
staying, etc.</p>

<p>“I hope I shall have the pleasure of
being presented to your wife. She is here,
is she not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but she is dancing at present.”</p>

<p>“Point her out, please; I am most
anxious to see her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>“Coming this way, in the white dress,
dancing with the Highlander.”</p>

<p>“Jove!” ejaculated the dragoon, when
she had passed. An enormous amount of
admiration was compressed into that one
syllable.</p>

<p>“You are a lucky fellow,” he added,
surveying his companion enviously. “If I
could get a wife like that, I’d marry to-morrow.
Has she a sister?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Has she a cousin with a family
likeness?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool, Carew,” replied Sir
Reginald impatiently.</p>

<p>“I’m perfectly serious. There, she is
sitting down now,” seizing his friend by
the arm; “come along and introduce me.”</p>

<p>But ere they reached the ottoman another
partner had claimed Alice and carried her
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Sir Reginald consolingly,
“come over to-morrow and dine
and sleep. That will be a much better
opportunity for making my wife’s acquaintance.”</p>

<p>Meantime Alice had been enjoying herself
excessively. She was very fond of
dancing; the floor and the music were all
that could be desired, and she had had a
succession of good partners. Her spirits, as
Geoffrey remarked to her, were quite up to
concert-pitch, and she was spending a very
pleasant evening.</p>

<p>“So was Reginald,” she thought, as she
observed him dancing every dance, and
selecting with much discrimination the
prettiest girls in the room! At length her
waltz, number fourteen, came round. She
had been in to supper with a young lord,
who, anxious to retain the belle of the
evening on his arm as long as possible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
was parading slowly up and down,
entreating her for “one more dance.”</p>

<p>“But I really cannot give you one; I
have already put down four extra dances
that are not on the card.”</p>

<p>“Let me look at your programme, if you
don’t mind,” he asked with cool superiority.</p>

<p>She handed it to him unhesitatingly.</p>

<p>Yes, every dance was full!</p>

<p>“Who is this fellow, R.M.F., who has got
himself down for the next? Can’t you throw
him over—forget all about it—and give it
to a very deserving young man instead?”</p>

<p>“How do you know that the other is
not a very deserving young man also?”
she asked with a smile.</p>

<p>“Who is he? He did not even give
you his valuable autograph! Maybe he
is not very keen about dancing—ten to
one he is at supper! Who is he?” he
repeated pertinaciously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>“He is my husband, since you insist
on knowing.”</p>

<p>“Your husband——” with an impatient
gesture, “oh, come then, that’s all right.
The laws of society don’t permit married
people to dance together. I never heard
of such a thing. You’ll give <i>me</i> the
dance, won’t you?” he added with tranquil
confidence.</p>

<p>“No, certainly not!” she replied quietly.</p>

<p>“But if he forgets all about it, as he
is sure to do—what then?”</p>

<p>“Your inference is not very flattering.
But in that ‘case unprecedented’ you may
have the dance with pleasure,” rejoined
Alice with a smile.</p>

<p>“You are not a <i>bride</i>, are you?” he
asked anxiously, after a moment’s silence.</p>

<p>“Oh no; I’ve been married more
than three years,” she returned with some
dignity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>“And may I ask if you always dance
with your husband at balls?”</p>

<p>“Never, as yet, since we have been
married,” she replied, looking down and
surveying the toe of her slender satin
shoe, with critical inspection.</p>

<p>“Well, mind you don’t throw me over.
Let us sit down here at the end of the
room till the band strikes up.”</p>

<p>Presently the strains of “Brises des Nuits”
was heard, recalling wandering dancers.</p>

<p>“Look, Lady Fairfax! here’s a good-looking
young hussar coming over here.
I know he is going to ask you to dance.
Remember your promise.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?” she asked indifferently.</p>

<p>“There, in the middle of the room. He
has stopped to speak to that little artillery-man
with the sandy moustache. Don’t you
see him? A handsome, determined-looking
fellow. I saw a fixed purpose in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
eye just now, but you won’t <i>hear</i> of it,
will you? Here he comes.”</p>

<p>“But he is my husband!” exclaimed
Alice triumphantly. “You see he did not
forget the dance after all.”</p>

<p>“That Fairfax? Why, I thought he
was quite elderly, and he does not look
more than six or seven and twenty. I see
he is a V.C., and I have been wondering
who he was all the evening. Will you
introduce me?”</p>

<p>“I believe this is our dance, Alice?”
said Sir Reginald, stiffly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so,” she replied, rising
with assumed indifference.</p>

<p>Having presented her late partner, she took
her husband’s arm and joined the dancers;
one step—two steps—and they floated off.</p>

<p>“How well that couple waltz,” was
remarked by more than one. “They are
the best dancers in the room,” observed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
a man who considered himself a good
judge and a still better performer.</p>

<p>Their step suited exactly, and they glided
easily in and out among the bumping, revolving
crowd, with a combination of ease
and grace that justified his remark.
Reginald’s London seasons stood him in
good stead; and when Alice felt his arm
firmly encircling her waist, and they
plunged into the giddy vortex, she was
perfectly confident that, so good was his
steering, so quick his eye, and so perfect
his step, that no matter what frantic or
ponderous couples were afloat, <i>she</i> would
meet with no collisions. She could not
restrain a pardonable feeling of pride as
she saw glance after glance levelled at
herself and her husband with unmistakable
approval. It was some time before
Steepshire society realised the stupendous
fact that “Fairfax was dancing with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
wife.” It was: “Who is the pretty girl
dancing with Fairfax?” or, “Who is the
hussar Lady Fairfax has got hold of?”
But when they had taken the idea well
into their minds they were dumbfounded.
“Where was the <i>divorcée</i>? Where was
the enraged husband? Above all, where
was the <i>idiot</i> who had promoted such a
scandal? The Fairfaxes were on the very
best of terms. They were the handsomest
couple in the room; they were <i>devoted</i> to
each other.” Such were the whispers that
floated round; and Alice was rehabilitated
as quickly as her friends could desire, and
placed, by public opinion, on the very top
rung of the social ladder.</p>

<p>Alice knew perfectly that her husband
had danced with her with an object in
view. She felt that it was a most decided
“duty dance.” Not for an instant did his
arm linger round her waist; not for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
second did his hand press hers. If she had
been the merest stranger he could not have
treated her with more distant ceremony.
She paused to take breath for a few
seconds, and they came to a standstill just
opposite a large mirror, which faced them
right across the room. She looked over,
and saw a tall slight girl in white, fanning
herself with a large feather fan; and it
also reflected a very good-looking hussar,
clad in all the pomp and panoply of his
profession. His dark-blue gold-laced uniform
became him well. He was leaning
against the wall, watching the crowd with
an air of supreme indifference and a
decidedly bored expression of countenance.
“Who would think we were husband and
wife?” thought Alice, as she glanced once
more at that couple across the room—“who,
indeed? I will make one more
effort to-night if I have an opportunity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
It will be my last attempt at making
friends. If I fail now I fail for ever.”</p>

<p>When the dance had concluded, Sir
Reginald led his partner through the series
of long rooms, in the wake of a multitude
of others; not a few drifted aside into
various sequestered bowers of flirtation,
but the mass of dancers kept on moving
down the great corridor; their goal appeared
to be the garden, and many couples were
soon scattered over its grassy sward. Our
hero and heroine found their way into
the conservatory. It was a charming place;
a dim religious light, distributed by Chinese
lanterns, sufficed to show gigantic tropical
plants, palms, pyramids of flowers, and
various cunningly-placed crimson seats for
<i>two</i>. Having found a vacancy in a retired
nook, Sir Reginald threw himself into one
corner of the sofa when Alice had seated
herself at the other; a silence, broken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
only by the murmur of half-a-dozen adjacent
flirtations and the splash of a fountain,
lasted for at least five minutes.</p>

<p>“What possessed me to come here?”
thought Reginald to himself. “Absence
of mind? I forgot for the moment it was
not old times. This is just the sort of
place we used to affect before we were
married.” He looked at his wife—contemplated
her with a grave critical scrutiny
almost severe. She was leaning back in
her corner, playing with her fan. The red
background of the couch threw her slender
graceful figure into bold relief. She was
very lovely, certainly; and now he came
to think of it, there <i>was</i> a melancholy look
on her face when in repose.</p>

<p>“Reginald,” she said, sitting up and
facing him, “do you remember the last
time we danced together?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>“No! I think not!” he answered
dubiously.</p>

<p>(I think you <i>do</i>, Sir Reginald.)</p>

<p>“It was at the Lancasters; we danced
together half the evening.”</p>

<p>“Did we? Then we must have made ourselves
rather remarkable,” he replied, with a
short laugh, breaking off a large bit of
fern and critically examining its fronds.</p>

<p>“Do you remember the ball at Burford
House?”</p>

<p>Considering that it was at that very ball
he had proposed to her, he could not well
plead forgetfulness.</p>

<p>“I do, of course,” he answered, glancing
at her quickly, and pausing in the act of
dissecting the fern bit by bit. “What is
the good of calling up these reminiscences?
There are some things which are best forgotten,”
he added with cool judicial serenity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>“Do you wish to forget <i>that</i> evening,
Reginald?” she asked in a tone of low
reproach, and raising her fan to hide her
trembling lips.</p>

<p>“Well, no,” he replied slowly and with
evident reluctance. “Not yet; but I quite
agree with Balzac that ‘Life would be intolerable
without a certain amount of forgetting;’
and I am glad to say that I have
forgotten <i>much</i>.”</p>

<p>“Why should you endeavour to forget?
Why are you so changed to me, Reginald?”
she asked with an enormous effort. “What
makes you so stern, so hard to me?” she
faltered, laying a timid little hand on his.
“Won’t you tell me?”</p>

<p>He would—he will—he is about to speak—he
has thrown away the fern-stalk, and
has taken her hand firmly in his own.
Precisely at this critical moment a well-known
voice exclaimed jovially:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>“So here you are!” and Geoffrey suddenly
appeared before them. “Fairly run
to earth! A nice dance you’ve led me.
None but a couple of regular professional
flirts would have found out this cover. Alice,
your partners are literally tearing each other
to pieces in the ball-room, and unless you
wish for <i>bloodshed</i> you had better be off—it’s
really serious!” offering his arm. “You
have five men waiting for the same dance.”</p>

<p>Oh, Geoffrey! Geoffrey! If you had
only come five minutes later! Reginald
dropped Alice’s hand like the traditional
live coal, and Alice shrank back into her
corner of the sofa at the first sound of her
cousin’s approach.</p>

<p>“I’m engaged for this too,” said Reginald,
rising and looking at his programme. “You
will take Alice back to the ball-room, I
suppose, then?” he observed, with extraordinary
command of countenance; and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
turning away, he sauntered off, ostensibly
in search of his own partner.</p>

<p>The ball was over; people were leaving
in crowds—the Fairfaxes among the first
flight.</p>

<p>“Alice,” said Geoffrey from his corner
of the carriage, “I am proud of you; you
took the shine out of them all to-night.
<i>Now</i> I can believe in the old duke’s
infatuation.”</p>

<p>“What duke?” asked Miss Ferrars
sleepily.</p>

<p>“Have you never heard that the old
Duke of St. Remo, old enough to be her
great-grandfather, fell madly in love with
my pretty little cousin when she was at
Nice, and proposed in due form?”</p>

<p>“Geoffrey, be quiet; you are really very
provoking. Do leave me alone,” crossly.</p>

<p>“Don’t interrupt; you know you are
very <i>proud</i> of his scalp, though you would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
not be a duchess. Is not his proposal kept
among our family archives to this day?”</p>

<p>“Geoffrey! only I am so sleepy I would
box your ears. Meanwhile, permit me to
remind you of one word—the mystic word,
<i>wait</i>!”</p>

<p>“Fancy, descending from a duke to a
baronet! I am a deeply injured man.
Only for your nonsense I might have been
quoting ‘My cousin, the duchess.’ You
would have made such a sweet little nurse.
I daresay you would have been spoon-feeding
the dear old fellow by this time, whereas,
thanks to your heartless conduct, he has
been hurried to an early grave.”</p>

<p>“How foolish of you not to have accepted
him, Alice,” put in Mary, with lazy interest.</p>

<p>“Was she not? Miss Fane did all she
could to make her; but she only cried and
sobbed, and made no end of scenes; so she
had to get her own way. You always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
<i>do</i> get your own way, don’t you, Lady
Fairfax?”</p>

<p>But all this was thrown away on Alice,
who was leaning back in her corner
apparently fast asleep.</p>

<p>“Only we had to go in our war-paint,
it was a very pleasant ball, wasn’t it,
Rex? I’m nearly smothered in this tunic.
I suppose you, as my senior officer, would
not hear of my taking it off, would you?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Reginald, with a yawn;
“suppose you follow the general example
and go to sleep. I’ll excuse <i>that</i> if you
like.”</p>

<p>A very weary, drowsy party ascended the
shallow steps of Monkswood, as the stars
were disappearing and giving place to the
gray dawn. With yawns and candles they
all dispersed, leaden-footed, to their own
apartments, to seek tired nature’s soft
restorer, sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>But there was little sleep for Sir Reginald,
nor had he any apparent inclination to woo
the fickle goddess, as he paced his long,
low-roofed bedchamber from end to end.</p>

<p>“What did Alice mean, to-night?” he
said to himself. “How weak I am where
she is concerned! I was on the point of
yielding; only for Geoffrey it was all over
with me. Fancy a Fairfax breaking his
word of honour—his oath! Well, in ten
days’ time I may go; in ten days more
I shall have made sufficient sacrifice to the
shrine of public opinion, and in ten days
I shall be out of the way of temptation.”</p>

<p>A knock at the door—an angry knock.</p>

<p>Enter to him Geoffrey, robed in a
dressing-gown of blinding brilliancy.</p>

<p>“I say, Rex, are you doing sentry go?
because, if <i>not</i>, will you have the goodness
to remember that my room is under yours?”</p>

<p>Exit, with slam of door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>Reginald accepted the rebuke, and ceasing
his promenade seated himself on the
edge of his bed in a very dissatisfied frame
of mind. He had miscalculated his strength
on which he piqued himself. His iron will
appeared a very flexible article to him now.
He had thought himself man enough to
remain at Monkswood, mixing daily and
familiarly with Alice, unmoved and unruffled,
the very embodiment of the typical
iceberg; and now he found he could not
bear it, it was too much for his self-control.
How capricious she was! one morning full
of solicitude for his safety, changing ere
evening like the veriest weathercock. On
rare occasions amazing him with a glimpse
of her former self, as on the day after
Helen’s arrival (attributed by him to the
immediate result of Helen’s influence), and
on the evening before the races. After that,
the thermometer of her manners changed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
from fair to freezing. But this evening
again there had been a thaw. What did
it mean? Better sustain an even temperament
throughout as he did. She was ready
enough to reproach him with harshness, to
win him into good-humour with herself, to
recur to the past as if there were no
barrier between them, and that barrier
wholly erected and sustained by her. Had
she forgotten that he had sworn he would
never be reconciled save on one condition?
Not likely; she must remember it as well
as he did himself.</p>

<p>“If I could believe that she cared for
me,” he said, “it would be different. Once
or twice I have been mad enough to think
so, but only for a moment; cool reflection,
and Alice’s subsequent treatment, effectually
dispelled my illusions on that score. She
never would have left me all those years
without one line; she never would have given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
me such a freezing reception, not one word
of welcome for the present or regret for the
past. Reginald Fairfax,” he added aloud,
as he rose and began to pull off his tunic,
“listen to common sense, keep out of your
wife’s way, for you are a greater fool than
I thought you; keep aloof from her
altogether, if you would wish to say when
you leave this roof for ever, all is lost
save <i>honour</i>. If she had had anything to
say to you, it would have been said long
ago. Sitting up all night won’t mend
matters. Sitting up all night won’t make
her ask you to forgive and forget; she will
never give in. And,” after a pause and
glancing at himself sternly in the glass,
“if I know <i>you</i>, you’ll never give in
either.” Having garrisoned his mind with
this reflection, he followed the example of
the household, and went to bed.</p>

</div>


<p>The morning after the ball, neither Mary
nor Alice appeared at breakfast, nor did they
descend till nearly luncheon-time. Helen
Mayhew’s portly figure was filling up a
goodly portion of the open window, as she
looked out on the terrace at Reginald
playing with Maurice.</p>

<p>“Come here, Alice,” she said, as Alice
languidly entered the room. “Is it not
a pretty sight to see Reginald with his
little boy?”</p>

<p>Alice approached and looked over her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
shoulder, and saw her husband leaning
against the balustrade and making a small
boat for Maurice, who, perched up beside
him on the broad parapet, was watching
his proceedings with the most lively
interest, occasionally making suggestions
and talking ceaselessly; the most thorough
understanding between the pair was evident.
Both faces were equally intent on
the work in hand, and the resemblance
between them was more striking than ever.
Suddenly Reginald glanced up and saw
Helen; lifting Maurice in his arms, he came
closer to the window.</p>

<p>“Look at my boat,” cried Maurice,
waving it towards her; “it’s going to
be painted blue, and I’m to sail it this
evening—he is going to show me;” ruffling
up his father’s short locks with small
tanned fingers.</p>

<p>Reginald set him down, and glanced from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
him to Helen with a smile of unbounded
pride, but catching sight of Alice the smile
died away, and nodding her a cool good-morning,
he turned away and led Maurice
up the steps into the house.</p>

<p>“Why does he treat me so?” whispered
Alice indignantly. “He never speaks of
the child to me, and scarcely notices him
when I am present, although he is my
child—I am his mother; he spends hours
with Maurice alone, and Maurice adores
him. What does he mean? Is he afraid
I would be jealous?”</p>

<p>“Ask him, my dear, ask him. Here he is,
and here is luncheon,” she answered gaily.</p>

<p>“What shall we do this afternoon?”
was the question that went round the
table. “It’s too hot to ride, too hot for
tennis. What shall we do?”</p>

<p>“Go and eat fruit in the garden,” suggested
Geoffrey serenely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>“What, the <i>whole</i> afternoon?” exclaimed
Reginald aghast.</p>

<p>“Let us first gather some fruit, and then
go for a walk up to the top of Beecher’s
Hill,” put in Miss Ferrars.</p>

<p>“Energetic young person! I admire,
but I decline to emulate your pedestrian
powers,” said Geoffrey, putting up his
eye-glass and gazing at her with calm
approval.</p>

<p>“To Beecher’s Hill we will go by all
means,” assented Helen. “I am quite in
the humour for a nice stroll.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty steep stroll I can tell
you! Don’t expect me to pull you up
the hill.”</p>

<p>“I never expect any politeness from
<i>you</i>, Geoffrey,” she replied with a smile.
“What a lazy, good-for-nothing boy you
are! Let us all go and get ready; by the
time we start it will be nearly four o’clock.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“But it would be madness to start now,”
expostulated Alice; “think of toiling uphill
in this broiling sun! Wait till it is
a little cooler.”</p>

<p>“The walk in the sun will do Helen
good. She wants severe exercise badly,”
said Geoffrey, looking at her dispassionately.
“If you were to put on a couple
of sealskin jackets, Reginald’s poshteen, and
my frieze ulster, you would be wise.”</p>

<p>“You are raving, my good Geoffrey!
Too much dancing has affected your
reason,” replied Mrs. Mayhew.</p>

<p>“I have method in my madness at
any rate—the symmetry of your figure at
heart,” responded the young man, with
an air of deep interest.</p>

<p>“I’m not a bit stouter than Mrs. Russell,
whom you profess to admire so much.”</p>

<p>“I don’t admire her at all! She is like
a bolster tied in the middle,” remonstrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
Geoffrey vehemently. “She has a figure
like a cottage loaf.”</p>

<p>“You may as well make him a present
of the last word, Helen,” observed Alice,
taking her by the arm and leading her
out of the room. “There is no use arguing
with him, he has <i>such</i> a tongue, and he
is utterly unscrupulous as to what he
says.”</p>

<p>“People who live in glass houses should
not throw stones,” shouted Geoffrey.</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed Alice, stopping with
one foot on the stairs, “I knew it! I
told you he would have the last word.
No one can silence him but Reginald, and,
to quote Geoffrey’s own language, he shuts
him up beautifully.”</p>

<p>Five o’clock found the walking party
reclining in various luxurious attitudes on
the top of Beecher’s Hill—they had evidently
but recently arrived. Alice and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
Geoffrey had scooped out a comfortable nest
in the side of a haycock, without loss of time,
and were resting after their joint labours.</p>

<p>Under an adjoining “wind” were the
remainder of the party. Helen, much out
of breath, was fanning herself with feverish
energy; Mark presented a grotesque
appearance, with loosened necktie, his head
covered by a large straw hat, under which
he had inserted an enormous cabbage-leaf,
which drooped gracefully over his eyes.
Prone at his feet lay Reginald, his hands
clasped behind his head, his hat tilted far
over his forehead—he looked the very
embodiment of lazy comfort. Alice turned
her attention for some time to the prospect
that lay beneath her eyes—a truly English
scene. Their own park was immediately
below; beyond that, deeply embedded in
trees, and merely discovering itself by the
smoke from its cottages, a pretty little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
hamlet tried to conceal itself; then came
golden corn-fields, the spire of a Norman
church, the steeple at Manister; a long
low range of purple hills framed the horizon.
It was a lovely summer’s evening, the air
was so clear one could see for miles; it was
so still, that various curious insects in the
grass and the booming of homeward-bound
bees alone broke the silence.</p>

<p>Something tickling her neck made Alice
abruptly turn her head; it was Geoffrey,
of course, with a long piece of spear-grass,
with which he had been diligently chasing
hay-spiders. “Alice,” he whispered, “let
us go over quietly and topple the whole
of the haycock over them, it will be no end
of fun. I don’t know which will be the most
furious, Reginald or Helen. Come along,”
holding out his hand encouragingly; “it is
an innocent pastime for an idle moment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>“No, no, Geoffrey; you had better not,
mind——”</p>

<p>“Well, will you promise to engage them
in lively conversation whilst I go behind
and loosen the whole concern? When I
cough I advise you to move.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have nothing to say to it. Do you
think I am a school-girl? I’m too old for
such nonsense!” cried Alice irritably.</p>

<p>“I think you are in one of your tempers,
that’s what I think,” returned her cousin in
a tone of candid conviction.</p>

<p>“If you think so you are very much
mistaken. You may dismiss <i>that</i> notion
from your mind.”</p>

<p>“I’m sincerely glad to hear it. What
was that you were saying to Reginald last
night in the conservatory when I came on
the scene? He did not look a bit too well
pleased to see me? Alice, have you ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
begged his pardon for the way you treated
him once upon a time? Tell me all about
it; I know you are yearning to unbosom
yourself to me,” he added with an air of
frank companionship, and sitting closer to
her.</p>

<p>“Geoffrey, your impertinence is really
intolerable!” exclaimed Alice haughtily,
and colouring with anger. “You quite
forget yourself!”</p>

<p>“Ah, I thought you were in a bad
humour just now,” he drawled; “I know
all the symptoms so well from sad experience;
so does Reginald, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“Don’t dare to speak to me, you have no
<i>right</i> to talk to me in such a way, and I
won’t listen to you!” exclaimed Alice with
flashing eyes.</p>

<p>“Little Spitfire!” ejaculated Geoffrey,
surveying her crimson cheeks with calm
derision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>Whereupon Alice indignantly turned her
back upon him and withdrew into her own
corner of the nest, where she sat in silent,
dignified retirement. She could see that
the others were spending their time far
more agreeably, and sincerely wished that
she was one of the party, but her pride
forbade her to move. Mary was evidently
telling them an amusing story with much
animation and gesticulation. A low but
highly appreciative laugh from Reginald,
as the tale concluded, showed that he had
been an attentive listener. Raising himself
on his elbow, he contributed his share to
the general entertainment in a few short
sentences; whatever he had said found
entire favour with his audience, and
elicited peals of applauding laughter from
all three, as he once more subsided, and
drew his hat over his eyes.</p>

<p>“He never thinks it worth his while to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
amuse <i>me</i> now,” thought Alice, with a
half-envious, half-wistful glance in that
direction.</p>

<p>“I’m being devoured alive by midges!”
suddenly exclaimed Geoffrey, jumping up
and waving his handkerchief madly to and
fro. “How you can stand them I can’t
imagine; they are in my hair!”—with
frenzied rubbing of his lint-white locks—“my
ears, my eyes! I shall go out of
my mind if I stay here any longer!
I say, Alice, can I speak to you
now?”</p>

<p>“Depends altogether upon the topic you
are going to broach,” replied Alice in a
frosty tone.</p>

<p>“Don’t look so grumpy, my dear little
girl,” reaching out a hand to help her to
rise, and of which she availed herself.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>
<p class="p0">quoted Geoffrey, dragging her into a perpendicular
position.</p>

<p>“Come along down to the river and see
if there are any trout rising.”</p>

<p>“There are none to rise.”</p>

<p>“There must be, it’s just their supper-time.
Well, anything is better than
squatting in the hay for the delectation of
the insect world; come and look for a bees’-nest
down in the bottom of the meadow.”</p>

<p>The hunt for the bees’-nest was fruitless.
Alice, for one, brought neither zeal nor
energy to the task. As they dawdled
slowly homewards, Geoffrey suddenly said,
as if struck by a brilliant idea:</p>

<p>“By Jove! next Tuesday the grouse
shooting commences, the glorious twelfth!
I don’t know how I’m to break the news
to you, Alice; but on Monday we must
part. Old Macfarlane has asked me this
year, thank the kind fates, and his moors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
and his shooting are simply—supreme. He
asked Rex too, and was awfully keen about
getting him, knowing him to be such a
good gun—the old boy takes no end of
pride out of his big bags—and only fancy,”
standing in the pathway, and declaiming,
with one waving arm, “he is <i>not</i> going.
Did you ever know such a duffer? Imagine
his refusing the primest shooting north
o’ Tweed! And for what? He gives no
reason, and I can’t even hazard a guess.
It certainly can’t be on <i>your</i> account,” contemplating
his cousin with a cool, deliberate,
speculative stare.</p>

<p>“If the question baffles your acute
imagination, of course it is utterly beyond
mine,” returned Alice, with an emphatic
shake of her lovely head and a perceptible
increase of colour. “See, Geoff,” she
added eagerly, “the others are all going
through the wood. We may as well go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
too; I want some moss and ferns for the
dinner-table.”</p>

<p>Having joined the rest of the party, a
general search for ferns commenced, and
they were gradually moving homewards,
when a masterly manœuvre of Geoffrey’s
left Alice and Reginald to bring up the
rear alone—a most unpremeditated <i>tête-à-tête</i>.</p>

<p>As they crossed a rustic bridge that
spanned a small but rapid torrent, they
paused and looked down at the foam sailing
along in solid-looking blocks; at the
wet and mossy rocks, and the small noisy
waterfall.</p>

<p>“How I should like to go down there
and dabble!” said Alice, taking off her
gloves.</p>

<p>In pulling off the left one she also drew
off her wedding-ring, which instantly disappeared
in the current below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>She looked after it, or rather at the spot
where it had fallen in, in silent consternation;
then, turning to her husband with
awestruck face, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“My ring is gone! What <i>am</i> I to do?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I can’t say,” he replied coldly.</p>

<p>“Can’t you fish it up some way—if you
were to wade in?” she cried excitedly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what <i>you</i> call wading, but
the water there is at least nine feet deep,
and your ring is probably a quarter of a
mile off by this time,” he answered, with
provoking indifference.</p>

<p>“But what am I to do for my wedding-ring?”
she urged piteously, looking down
at her hand with burning cheeks.</p>

<p>“Buy another, I conclude; you can get
one for a guinea or thirty shillings. It
depends upon whether you like them thick
or thin. This will be your <i>third</i>, so you
must have quite a settled opinion on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
subject,” he replied, calmly aiming bits
of gravel at a particular rock in the torrent
below.</p>

<p>Certainly this was not encouraging
behaviour; nevertheless, she braced up her
courage, and determined to make one
more attempt to recover her original
ring.</p>

<p>“Give me my own ring, Reginald.”</p>

<p>“I have already told you, Alice, that I
will <i>not</i>,” he returned, still pursuing his
amusement.</p>

<p>“And will you never take me back as
your wife?” she asked almost inaudibly.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he inquired,
arresting himself in the act of taking aim,
and turning towards her at last.</p>

<p>“What I say,” she replied with more
firmness.</p>

<p>“I shall be only too glad to take you
back, as you call it, now—this instant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>“Do you really mean it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course I do; but have you not
something to say to me besides,” he asked,
looking at her anxiously.</p>

<p>Was ever anyone so blind to the right
employment of great opportunities?</p>

<p>“No,” she replied innocently; “what
more can I say than I have already said?
I have nothing to say.”</p>

<p>“Than what you have already said!”
he cried indignantly. “You dare to allude
to it? you are not ashamed of it?”</p>

<p>“No,” she faltered, much bewildered.</p>

<p>Her husband scarcely heard her. His
face was dark with passion; his voice
vibrated with intense emotion as he added:</p>

<p>“Such a gratuitous repetition of insult
I never heard of. You want an answer
to your question; you want to know when
I shall take you back? I give it to you
in one word: <i>never</i>”—a long pause, during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
which Alice stood dazed and stupefied—she
felt as if a dark wave of trouble had overwhelmed
her senses. “The day after to-morrow,”
he proceeded firmly, “I am going
to Looton. I shall take Maurice with me, to
keep me company. You have had him for
more than three years, remember,” he replied
to the remonstrance he saw in her eyes. “I
will send him back to you when I go down
to Northampton, and you may keep him
for the next four years.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Reginald?” interrupted
Alice, struggling hard for composure,
and fixing on him a strained, eager gaze.</p>

<p>“I mean that until Maurice is seven he
may stay with you; after that time I hope
to have returned from India, and settled
down at Looton, and I intend to have him
to live with me. I am not going to be a
wanderer all my life; I owe some duties
to my people, as well as to my country.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
You will not mind parting with
Maurice. You have shown me to-night
plainly that you are utterly heartless.”</p>

<p>“Do I understand,” she faltered, supporting
herself by the railing, “that you
will take Maurice from me in four years’
time?”</p>

<p>“Yes; legally I have a right to do so.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” she cried passionately.
“No law could be so wicked as to
deprive me of my only child. What a
cruel hard-hearted man you are to say
such things to me. Can you be the
Reginald Fairfax I married? Your voice
and appearance are identical, but otherwise
you are as different as night and
day. <i>He</i> was only too good to me, he
loved me far better than I deserved.”</p>

<p>“He did indeed,” interrupted her husband
grimly.</p>

<p>“You,” she pursued almost fiercely,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
“have a heart like stone, a tongue like a
sword. You are stern, harsh, implacable,
tyrannical; you can’t be the same.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” he answered decisively;
“I am <i>not</i> the original Reginald Fairfax; I
am an older and wiser, if not better man.
My illusions have been dispelled, my susceptibilities
blunted, my eyes rudely opened.
I know <i>you</i> to be an extraordinary combination
of caprice, obstinacy, and inconsistency.”
He broke off, and looked at her
with a mixture of contempt and indignation;
he dared not trust to speech.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean; I have
abased myself sufficiently, my conscience
tells me,” she replied, with quivering lips.
“You thrust me aside with scorn, and
even add that you will take my child
from me.” Here her grief overcame all
considerations, and covering her face with
her hands she burst into tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>There was a very dark look on her
husband’s face as he surveyed her for some
moments in silence; he was extremely
angry with her; he thought she had befooled
him again, played with his feelings
as a cat with a mouse. He was wounded
to the heart and bitterly disappointed.
Each day he had been lingering on in
hopes of one word of regret. With even
<i>one</i> he would have been satisfied. To
tell him she thought the same as ever
was too much; it was inconceivable, it
was impossible, it was maddening. “She
must be a born actress,” he thought as he
stood opposite her. “This grief is all
feigned.” Still, as he watched the tears
trickling through her fingers he relented
somewhat. In the first place he could
not endure to see any woman crying,
much less Alice. She little knew what
a powerful weapon she was using against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
him. As he looked at her slight figure,
heaving with half-suppressed sobs, his conscience
smote him. He <i>was</i> hard, cruel,
and tyrannical. After all she was only a
girl, and a very frail, delicate one too.
Was this the way to guard her as the
apple of his eye, to restore her to health,
to study every wish?—scarcely.</p>

<p>“Alice,” he said, gently removing her
hands, “don’t cry like this; I can’t bear
to see you.”</p>

<p>“Then, why do you make me cry?” she
sobbed plaintively.</p>

<p>“I won’t do it again,” offering her his
handkerchief; her own had gone home in
Geoffrey’s charge, filled with moss and
roots. “I never saw you cry before, and
I hope I never shall again.”</p>

<p>“Then you won’t take Maurice from me,”
she pleaded, raising her tear-stained face to
his, with a look of passionate supplication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>“No, but you will lend him to me sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Ye-es,” very dubiously; “but you can
always come here to see him.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, I never intend coming here
again. Once I leave I shall never return.”</p>

<p>“Never return!” The words seemed to
echo and vibrate through the dim leafy
silence of the surrounding trees.</p>

<p>“Oh, Reginald!”</p>

<p>“Now, Alice, you are never going to be
so foolish as to cry for <i>that</i>,” he asked
roughly.</p>

<p>Sobs. What was he to do with her?</p>

<p>“Alice, why are you crying? You
promised me that you would not.”</p>

<p>They were now walking home; but
Alice’s supply of tears seemed unlimited.
This was a new and alarming experience.</p>

<p>“Alice,” he repeated, “you promised
me you would not cry any more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, but you promised”—gasp—“you
would not make me cry”—gasp. “I know
you think me no better than a baby, but
I can’t help it—I can’t, indeed.”</p>

<p>More very bitter tears.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, in despair, “if I come
here for a few days at Christmas, will you
be satisfied?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she faintly whispered.</p>

<p>“Then dry your eyes; don’t let me see
another tear. You have had your own
way altogether, have you not?—tyrant as I
am!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied, with a sickly smile.</p>

<p>She looked so pale, dishevelled, and wan,
that he felt absolutely guilty as he gazed at
her forlorn-looking face.</p>

<p>Silently and rapidly they pursued the
woodland path, where barely two might
walk abreast. Above them the trees had
laid their heads together, and combined in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
league to keep out the sun. A stillness
weighed on the surrounding woods; the
wind had died away; the birds were silent.
Not more silent than the bronzed young
soldier and the pale agitated girl, who
walked together, side by side.</p>

<p>Alice was in hopes of reaching her room
unseen. But no such good fortune was in
store for her. On the stairs she came face-to-face
with Geoffrey, who, calmly surveying
her tear-stained cheeks, gave a long
and eloquent whistle, and chanted, as he
passed downstairs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But, children, you should never let</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Your angry passions rise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your little hands were never made</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To tear each other’s eyes.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On entering the library, he found
Reginald making lame excuses for Alice’s
non-appearance to Helen, who was pouring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
out tea. He boldly walked over to him
and whispered right into his ear:</p>

<p>“You’ve been bullying her, I see.”</p>

<p>Reginald’s indignant negative was completely
thrown away on Geoffrey, who had
already seated himself at the tea-table,
under the shelter of Helen’s protection.
So ended this disastrous walk.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Alice’s reflections as she stood at her
window in the gloaming were not of a
very rose-coloured hue. All that she most
valued in this world—her husband’s love—had
slipped from her grasp. The efforts
she made to be reconciled were utterly in
vain; a cool, determined indifference met
and repulsed all her advances; advances
which she afterwards blushed to remember,
and propitiated her wounded pride by increased
haughtiness and reserve.</p>

<p>“It was hard to realise that he <i>was</i> her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
husband,” she thought, as very, very bitter
tears welled up into her eyes. With what
distant politeness and formality he treated
her! If he unintentionally touched her,
or brushed against her, he apologised as
ceremoniously as if she were a stranger.
He treated her as such, even though he
had promised to be her friend. What
would she not give to recall the reception
she had given him? Too late to think of
that now! he had taken her at her word—they
were strangers. How would it all
end? No matter what occurred, she could
not well be more miserable than she was—a
despised, disowned, detested wife!</p>

<p>It is a sultry August evening; Mary
Jane, the upper housemaid, much refreshed
by her comfortable tea, is sitting at an open
window, gossiping with the head laundry-maid,
and unpicking a brown merino dress,
which she is praising to the skies.</p>

<p>“Real French, four shillings a yard. We
all got dresses when Sir Reginald was
married. I’ve had this three winters, and
thanks to the lining, there’s a good three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
winters’ more wear in it yet. I would have
left it as it is, only it’s old-fashioned you
see,” holding it up with a deprecating
gesture. “Parker is going to lend me
one of Lady Fairfax’s for a pattern, that
cream-coloured one; she had it on on
Sunday.”</p>

<p>“Eh,” said her companion—whose fingers
were equally busy, giving some startling
finishing touches to a Dolly Varden hat—“but
it will never suit <i>you</i>. You’re too
plump, Mary Jane; what looks well on a
slip of a girl like her is nothing to go by;
one of Miss Ferrars’ dresses now would
be more your style. That rose and gray
thing, with the kilted skirt, and the plaster
up the front, for instance. This brown,
piped with red, and red bows like hers,
would look fine and fashionable.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you are right,” replied Mary
Jane, putting her thimble in her mouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
and looking at her friend reflectively. “I’ll
have a look at it this evening whilst they
are at dinner. The gray one did you say?”</p>

<p>“See, here they come! the whole riding
party!” exclaimed the laundry-maid with
animation. “Just look, Polly, and you’ll
see Sir Reginald will never offer to lift
my lady off her horse, he leaves it to
Mr. Geoffrey. See, there, I told you so!
Ain’t they just a queer couple? I can’t
make them out. If they were old, or if
one of them was ugly even, you might
understand. They do say,” she continued
confidentially, “as how Sir Reginald never
meant to marry her, nor anyone, only she
was his ward and he thought that it would
be the best way to look after her, but that
he don’t care two straws about her; he hates
womankind, Cox says.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure,” replied Mary Jane,
with a toss of her head, “if that sweet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
young lady isn’t good enough for him, I
should like to know what he wants more!
She’s too good for him, I’m thinking; that’s
what ails him! He may be very handsome,
and a great fighter—and he is a
grand-looking young gentleman—but I
think he treats her shameful, if all be
true, never speaking to her nor looking
at her no more nor if she were a marble
statue set up in the corner. I’ll never
forget how good she was to me when I
had a sore hand last winter, dressing it
her own self every day, and always speaking
to me so nice and kind all the time.
Dear, dear! If Philip Banks was to turn
out such a husband as hers I should cry
off, I can tell you,” she concluded, with a
decided slap of her bare hand on the stone
window-sill. “I did hear,” she continued,
“as how he was very fond of her once.
I was sick and at home when they came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
to Looton, but they say as he downright
worshipped her just at first. Mrs. Morris
herself told me, but I don’t believe it. I
never saw no signs of it. Seeing’s believing
to my mind. Laws! what’s this in the
lining? A letter, I declare! It must have
run down from the pocket-hole. My stars,
Johanna, whatever shall I do?” turning
a very dismayed countenance to her friend.
“It’s a letter Lady Fairfax gave me to post
a good three years ago to Sir Reginald.
I remember now quite well reading the
address. She seemed so terribly put out
that the post-bag had gone, and as I was
going down to the village, I offered to
take it along with three or four from the
servants’ hall. I put them all in my
pocket, and this has slipped into the lining
instead. What <i>am</i> I to do?” she asked
with breathless volubility.</p>

<p>“I would ask Mrs. Morris, if I were you.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
There she is in the passage now; run and
catch her.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris said:</p>

<p>“Take it to Sir Reginald after dinner,
and tell him how it happened; honesty is
the best policy.”</p>

<p>“Not for millions! I’ll take it to my
lady, if you like. She could not scold if
she tried ever so.”</p>

<p>“He won’t say a word to you either,
Mary Jane. He is just his father all over.
There never was a quieter nor a kinder
master; and, besides, how could anyone
scold you for what was an accident?”</p>

<p>“I tell you, Mrs. Morris, I’m afraid of
my life of him. I see him every morning
coming down before seven. He passes me
just as if I was a sweeping brush. Now
if it was Mr. Geoffrey—he always has a
word and a joke—I’m not a bit afraid of
<i>him</i>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Geoffrey is a good deal too fond
of joking and jesting with servants and
keeping them from their work; and you
will just take that letter and give it to
Sir Reginald before you sleep to-night,”
concluded Mrs. Morris authoritatively.</p>

<p>“But he looks so stern and severe, I
shall just sink into the ground if he gives
me one of those sharp looks of his.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you talk rubbish, Mary Jane;
go and give up that letter after dinner, and
be off to your rooms now.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Dinner over, the laundry-maid came into
the servants’ hall, and whispered to her
reluctant friend:</p>

<p>“Now is your time, Polly. They are all
in the pleasure-ground except Sir Reginald,
and he’s writing in the library, Thomas says.
Just you go and give a knock at the door, and
hand in the letter; he can’t <i>eat</i> you. I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
go with you as far as the swing-door,” she
added generously, “and wait.”</p>

<p>With loudly-beating heart, Mary Jane
arrived at the library-door, knocked, and
entered. Her master was writing at a
table by the light of a reading-lamp. He
looked up, and gazed into the shadow for
some seconds before he exactly made her
out.</p>

<p>Then, laying down his pen, he said:</p>

<p>“Well, what is your business? One of
the servants, are you not?”</p>

<p>There was more of the “orderly-room”
in his manner than was altogether pleasant.
His dealings with soldiers’ wives were short,
sharp, and decisive; the very unruly women
of the Seventeenth Hussars were more afraid
of three words from the Major than a hundred
from the Colonel.</p>

<p>He imagined that Mary Jane had come
to lodge some complaint, so he repeated:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>“What can I do for you? what do you
want?”</p>

<p>“Please sir, I’m Foster, the upper housemaid,
and it’s about this letter,” said she,
timidly approaching, and laying down the
yellow, crumpled missive.</p>

<p>“A letter,” he repeated carelessly,
taking it up; but seeing the superscription,
he changed colour. “And <i>where</i>,
may I ask, did you get this?”</p>

<p>“Please sir, Lady Fairfax gave it to me
to post more than three years ago. It
must have slipped down between the lining
of my dress and the pocket. I found it
just now when I was ripping up the skirt.
I’m very sorry indeed, sir, for I remember
now that Lady Fairfax was very particular
about it. I made sure I had posted it with
the others.”</p>

<p>“Well, at any rate it was not your
fault,” he exclaimed, after some reflection,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
turning over the long looked for letter in
his hand. “It was honest of you to bring
it to me; you might have burnt it, and
said nothing about it; and it happens to
be a letter of the very greatest consequence.
Here,” said he, unlocking a drawer, “is a
note instead,” handing her ten pounds;
“and see that your pockets have no holes
in them in future.”</p>

<p>Mary Jane received the gift with profuse
and voluble thanks, as she backed and
curtseyed out of the room; and from that
time forward declared that her master
was the nicest, pleasantest, most generous
gentleman in England.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that Sir Reginald
lost no time in tearing open the letter,
which ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Husband</span>,</p>

<p>“You will be surprised to get a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
letter from me, considering my very recent
heartless wicked treatment of you, and more
surprised still to hear that I am writing to
entreat your forgiveness. Ever since you
left I have been so very, very miserable,
and as each day has passed I have been
more firmly convinced of your innocence,
and that I have been the most unjust and
ungenerous of wives. You will, I know,
make allowance for my youth and a
naturally jealous hot temper. These are
but feeble excuses; no one but you, who
have always been so good to me, would
entertain them for an instant. I sometimes
think I must have been mad; any
way, whatever <i>you</i> may do I shall never
forgive myself. But you will pardon me,
I know; not only because of your promise,
but because—how can I tell you? I had
a bad fainting fit the other day, and Morris
was frightened and sent for the doctor; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
says that before summer, all being well,
there will be a little inmate in the nursery
here. I have not told this great secret to
anyone, neither must you. Long before
summer your letter will have come, won’t
it? Once this has fairly started, I shall
count the very days till the answer comes
back. If none comes I will know that you
<i>cannot</i> forgive me, and indeed I don’t
deserve that you should. But you <i>will</i>
write to me a kind letter too, my darling
Regy. Think how very lonely I am, I
have no one but you in all the world.
The post is just going out, so I must conclude.
I direct this by the address you
left with Helen, so it will be sure to reach
you safely. Mind you write by return
mail to</p>

<p class="right">
“Your loving and penitent wife,<br>

</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>When he had read this to the end he laid
it down, and began to pace about the room
in great agitation.</p>

<p>“What a brute I must seem to her!
What must she have thought of me all
these years? Why, no later than yesterday”—he
paused in his walk, overwhelmed
with the recollection—“I rejected her overtures
for peace. I was savagely rude to
her. My poor little Alice, you had indeed
said quite enough, more than enough,” he
muttered, resuming his walk. “What must
she think of me? How can she have borne
with me all this time? I refused, yes, point-blank,
to kiss her, idiot that I was. I
might have guessed at something of this
kind, only that my devilish pride had
strangled my common sense; and all this
frightful misunderstanding was owing to
this wretched bit of paper, this letter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
that I would have given five years of
my life for, and she, poor girl, has been
breaking her heart about, and all the time
it has been lying inside the skirt of that
woman’s dress. After all,” he continued,
taking it up, “it is a very dear and
precious letter; I would not part with it,
late as it comes, for a field-marshal’s
bâton.” He read it twice over again,
lingering on almost every word, then
folded it up very carefully and put it in
his waistcoat-pocket as he walked to the
window. “No wonder,” said he, “she
gave me a cool reception; I wonder what
sort of one she would give me <i>now</i> if I
could catch her alone? She ought to hate
me pretty well by this time, it is not <i>my</i>
fault if she does not. But she likes me
a little bit still. She must, or she never
could have stood the way I have treated
her. If she only cares for me just one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
quarter as much as I care for her we shall
do very well,” he thought to himself joyfully,
as he stepped out of the window and
joined the party who were sitting in the
pleasure-ground, basking in the moonlight,
and inhaling the soft bracing air, heavy
with the perfume of syringa, roses, and
new-mown hay.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Mayhew, Miss Saville, and
Mary were reposing in various garden-chairs.</p>

<p>“Where is Alice?” asked her husband
abruptly.</p>

<p>“Oh, she and Geoffrey have gone to
gather pears for the public weal.”</p>

<p>“What, at this hour!” he exclaimed,
standing at the top of the steps, gazing
after two figures who were rapidly disappearing
in the direction of the garden.
“Small chance of a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with Alice
to-night,” he said to himself as he pulled
his moustache thoughtfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>Five minutes later, Geoffrey came running
back alone; breathlessly he jerked
out: “<i>Such</i> a trick as I’ve played her!
She offered to race me to the big pear-tree,
each starting from the garden-gate,
and going one north the other south; I
agreed, and when I saw her well started
south I just came home! What a state
she will be in when she finds herself alone
at the end of the ghost-walk! She says
she is <i>not</i>, but I believe she is, horribly
afraid of ghosts and bogies; and if she
meets the cavalier who is said to stalk
about the garden won’t it be fun? I
only wish I had thought of it in time, I’d
have dressed up. It pays her off nicely
for some of the pretty little jokes she has
practised on me. It’s not too late yet”—snatching
up a shawl and a garden-hat
and commencing a toilet.</p>

<p>“I can’t say that I exactly see the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
humour of the situation,” said Reginald,
as, springing down the steps and vaulting
lightly over an iron railing, he set off by
a short cut to the garden at a run.</p>

<p>“Active fellow, is he not?” observed
Geoffrey, removing the shawl in which he
had already enveloped himself. “But this
alacrity in joining his wife, in the present
overcharged state of the domestic atmosphere,
is something quite new. The sky is
not going to fall, is it?” he added, looking
up interrogatively.</p>

<p>“No; but really, Geoffrey, you shouldn’t
have left her,” remonstrated Helen. “The
garden is an awful eerie place by moonlight,
I should not care to take a solitary walk
there myself.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The pear-tree, which was to have been
the goal, was the pear-tree <i>par excellence</i>
of the whole garden; it was trained along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
a wall covered with fruit-trees, beneath which
ran a broad gravel terrace, approached by
several flights of steps, one of which was
exactly opposite this particular tree.</p>

<p>Alice, breathless and triumphant, had
arrived first at the foot of the steps. She
looked up and down the broad walk; no
sign of Geoffrey.</p>

<p>“How very odd,” she thought.</p>

<p>Presently she heard his rapidly-approaching
footsteps, and, mounting the terrace,
began to gather pears with much deliberation.
Hearing him arrive, she never
troubled to turn her head, merely
remarking as she reached up for a lovely,
yellow, corpulent pear:</p>

<p>“Snail! You ought to be ashamed of
yourself. I could trundle a wheelbarrow
faster than you can run.”</p>

<p>“Could you indeed?” replied her husband,
putting his arm round her slender waist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>“Geoffrey, how dare——Reginald!”
she gasped, dropping all the pears.</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> may <i>dare</i>, may I not?” said he,
taking her in his arms and giving her
twenty kisses. “Look here,” said he,
smiling at her indignant eyes and crimson
cheeks, “I’ve just had a letter from you,
my darling,” producing the letter and
hurriedly telling her the story.</p>

<p>“And the other one I wrote to Afghanistan?”
she asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>“That I never heard of till now; the
Afridis made short work of our letters.”</p>

<p>“Then you have never had a line from me
till to-day?” she cried, backing towards the
wall and looking at him with dilated eyes.</p>

<p>“Never, since I left Cannes.”</p>

<p>“Then oh, Regy, <i>what</i> must you have
thought of me?”</p>

<p>“Just what I have been asking myself,
<i>what</i> can you have thought of me? No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
wonder you called me harsh, cruel, and
tyrannical; such names were too mild a
term for me. What an unmanly, vindictive
wretch I must have appeared! And
you, you richly deserve the name of the
‘patient Grizzel.’ Don’t you think so?”
drawing her towards him by both hands.
“Come, tell me what you thought of me
for never answering your letter.”</p>

<p>Too overwhelmed to speak, she stood
dumb before him, with both her little
trembling hands in his.</p>

<p>“You can’t think,” he went on, “how I
hoped and hoped for even one line, after
that Cheetapore affair had been cleared up.
Surely then I learnt that ‘hope deferred
maketh the heart sick.’”</p>

<p>Seeing the ready tears in Alice’s eyes he
stopped.</p>

<p>“Why, you little goose, you are never
going to cry <i>now</i>, are you? It was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
your fault I did not get your letter. I
have it safe now, and I am the happiest
man in England this instant; that is to
say,” lowering his voice almost to a
whisper, “if you will forgive me, Alice,
and if you love me still?”</p>

<p>“Forgive you!” she echoed, speaking with
an effort, “it is for you to forgive <i>me</i>. Do
forgive me,” she pleaded, with lovely beseeching
eyes; “it cost me more than <i>you</i>. My
punishment seemed at times greater than
I could bear.”</p>

<p>At the mere recollection of what she had
endured, two large tears that could no
longer be suppressed escaped from her eyelashes,
and rolled down her pale cheeks.</p>

<p>“My Alice, my love, you were forgiven
long, long ago; only it seemed to me, till
now, that you did not want my forgiveness.
You would not speak, and I could not; I
tied my hands most effectually that day on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
Southsea pier. And, after all, Alice, you
would not have respected me if I had not
required some apology, or if I had tendered
you a forgiveness you had never asked for,
after the way you broke up our home and
turned me adrift. No, my darling,” in
answer to a piteous look, “I am not scolding
you. I never, never will be rough or rude
to you again, if you will promise to forgive
me for the barbarous way I have treated you
lately. When I think of the thousand-and-one
rudenesses I’ve been guilty of—intentionally
too—I feel that I am asking a great
deal. If I had only your capacity for
blushing, you would see how thoroughly
ashamed I feel. Am I to be forgiven?”
leaning towards her.</p>

<p>“Of course you are.”</p>

<p>“And,” speaking still more earnestly,
“you like me a little in spite of all?”</p>

<p>A deep blush was his only answer for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
some seconds; then, with an effort, she
raised her truthful eyes to his, and said:</p>

<p>“You know I do; you need not have
asked. It is,” she pursued, with emotion,
“far more a question whether—whether you
care for me. I know you never will, never
can, as you once did; but it has seemed
to me at times that you almost hated
me.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?” with a beaming smile long
foreign to his countenance; “I see you are
more easily imposed upon than ever. You
know very well, it is patent to even
Geoffrey, that I have always loved you
exactly three times better than you love
me. It is not in your nature to love as
I do, though I never make much fuss about
my feelings; still you may as well know
that you are more to me, ten times over,
than anything in the world. Even at the
worst of times it has always been the same.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
What troubled me most, when I thought I
was dying, was, <i>not</i> my many sins and
shortcomings, <i>not</i> the thought of a future
world, <i>not</i> what ought to come first with
all of us, my soul; no, it was you, that I
might only see you once more, even for
an instant, was the prayer, the thought,
that never left me night or day. I will not
conceal from you, Alice, that I did my very
best to stifle recollection, to forget you, to
throw my whole heart into my profession.
It was no good; nothing, not a draught
of the Egyptian nepenthe itself would have
banished you from my heart. When I
first went to India I used to take long
headlong rides, half in hopes of galloping
away from my thoughts, half in hopes of
killing myself. I sometimes think I was
a little mad then.”</p>

<p>“Reginald, you must have been,” she
exclaimed with conviction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; you don’t half know how miserable
I’ve been without you. Well, I quieted
down in time, and when the fighting came
off I took it out of myself in that way.
But wherever I was, you were seldom
absent from my mind; whether alone in
my quarters, or sitting round a noisy camp
fire, or on a still starry night, on the line
of march, your face was ever before me.
As to never caring for you as before, I
believe I love you better—yes, better than
when we were first married; though had
anyone suggested such a possibility at the
time, I would have throttled him on the
spot. But do not,” he continued with a
smile, “spread the fact among the young
married ladies of your acquaintance; they
might try and follow your example, with
scarcely such happy results. Lovers’
quarrels are not <i>always</i> the renewing of
love.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>“How can you joke on such a subject,
Regy?” she asked almost inarticulately.</p>

<p>“Well, then, I’ll be serious once more.
Never, as long as you live, doubt my love
for you, Alice. Do you believe in it
now?”</p>

<p>“I do,” she whispered, “and you have
made me very, very happy.”</p>

<p>“Then you can’t refuse to make <i>me</i>
happy! You have not given me one kiss
yet, remember, and you have three years’
arrears to make up. To begin with, I’ll
take the one you offered me the other
night now.”</p>

<p>“I daresay you will,” she replied demurely,
with a spice of her old spirit.
“Have you ever heard, ‘He that will not
when he may,’ etc.? And you took quite
enough just now to last you for a long
time,” she added, with a deep blush.</p>

<p>“You are not going to put me on allowance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
are you? I tell you plainly I won’t
stand it. After offering me a kiss you
never can again pretend you are shy.
Now, candidly, <i>can</i> you? I’m afraid you
are a little impostor,” quietly insinuating
his arm round her waist.</p>

<p>“I see you are as great a tease as ever,
at any rate, Reginald,” she exclaimed
tragically. “If you ever dare to allude
to my foolish, idiotical offer, I won’t say
what I shall do to you. I am not an
impostor, and you know very well I <i>am</i>
shy; you often said it—it——”</p>

<p>“Well, go on, I would not commence
a sentence I was afraid to finish if I were
you!”</p>

<p>“Well, that it was my only fault—there!”</p>

<p>“And so it was; and as you are cured
now of course you are perfect.”</p>

<p>A silence. At length she said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>“Were you really going away to-morrow,
Regy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed I was. I have been lingering
on here from day to day, hoping for
one little word, just one, and it did not
come. I would have gone back into the
world a hard, embittered, cynical man.
You smile, you think I am that already?”</p>

<p>“Tell me, Regy, will you be the very
same Regy I knew of old, and will the
rude, cold, stern guardian I have met
lately, and—I tell you in confidence that
I am a little afraid of—will he go?”</p>

<p>“He will,” replied her husband, with
quiet decision. “He will take his departure
along with the haughty young
lady with whom he gets on so well. Are
you sorry? Are you sorry to lose your
guardian and find your husband?”</p>

<p>“Sorry!” she repeated, taking the flower
out of his button-hole with the calmest air<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
of rightful appropriation. “Do I <i>look</i>
sorry? By-the-way, for the third time
of asking, you may as well give me my
wedding-ring”—fastening the flower in
the front of her dress, and holding out a
small white palm. “How glad I shall
be to see it again,” she exclaimed, as she
eagerly watched him disengaging it from
his chain.</p>

<p>“Here it is,” handing it to her; “it
is a travelled ring.”</p>

<p>“Let me see”—turning it to the moonlight
and scrutinising it closely—“if it is
my own. Yes, there is the ‘R. A.’ entwined.
Now please to put it on.”</p>

<p>“Alice,” he said, taking her little ring-less
hand in his and slipping it on her
finger, “remember, you are not to remove
it again.”</p>

<p>“I never will, you may be very sure,
as long as I live, and when I die it shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
be buried with me. See, it is quite too
big for me now,” holding up her hand.</p>

<p>“It is indeed,” he reluctantly owned to
himself, as he looked at the fragile, almost
transparent fingers held up for his inspection.
An agonising thought flitted through
his brain and turned his heart, as it were,
to ice. “Had he gained her but to lose
her after all?”</p>

<p>“Why do you shiver?” cried Alice
gaily. “Why do you look so odd—you
are not ill, are you?”</p>

<p>“Ill? Not I!” recovering himself with
an effort. “It is probably your friend the
goose walking over my grave.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk of graves,” she said with a
shudder, drawing nearer to him involuntarily,
and laying her hand on his shoulder.
“You don’t know,” she added in a low
voice, “what a good wife I am going to
be. You have given me back my wedding-ring,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
and in return I promise solemnly to
be truthful, loving, and obedient as long
as I live. Nothing but death can ever
come between us now,” she added tremulously,
as, stealing her arm round his neck,
she gave him the tenderest and shyest of
kisses.</p>

<p>“You little witch!” he exclaimed, returning
it with interest. “Do you know that
that is almost the first kiss you have ever
given me of your own accord, Lady Fairfax?
What a change a few hours can make in
one’s life! This morning, mine seemed so
empty, so cheerless; just what it has been
for the last three years. I had no one to
look after, or care about much, except
myself, and I am not very fond of myself;
sometimes, I know all my faults quite as
well, nay, far better than you do.”</p>

<p>“What are they?” she asked with a
smile. “Let us compare notes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>“I am determined to the verge of
obstinacy, and beyond it. Proud to a
degree little short of insanity. Overbearing,
supercilious, tenacious, I would die
sooner than yield, once I have made up
my mind that I am in the right. If I
had been less blinded by my pride, I
would have written to you when Maurice
was born, and saved us both two long
miserable years. How can I ever make
amends to you, my darling? How can I
ever overtake these years I have left you
alone?”</p>

<p>“Hush!” she said, “you must not abuse
yourself. It has been all my fault from
first to last; it is only like you to take the
blame, but you know very well it all lies at
<i>my</i> door. But, indeed, indeed I have been
punished, and justly punished! I ought
to have trusted you, Reginald; if I had
followed my first impulse I would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
spared myself many a bitter tear. I seem
to have been under some malign influence,
and to have had an absolute vocation for
making you and myself miserable, that
awful winter that seems so many years
ago. Since then, Time has crawled by and
brought no remedies for <i>me</i>—a blank empty
future, and nothing to look back on but
hateful haunting recollections; only for
Maurice I must have gone melancholy mad.
You will never leave me again, will you?</p>

<p>“You won’t go to Looton now?” she
added suddenly.</p>

<p>“Yes; in fact I must. I’ll run down
there for a few days and see how everything
is getting on, look into the accounts,
ride over the home farm, etc., and tell
them to be ready for us at Christmas.”</p>

<p>“At Christmas?” she echoed in amazement.</p>

<p>“Yes. I shall then come back here and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
take you off abroad for the next three
months. You were talking of Nice the
other day: will you accept <i>me</i> as a
companion instead of your aunt? How
would you like to spend the autumn in
Italy?”</p>

<p>“And Maurice?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Maurice will be made over to
Helen; she will take excellent care of him.
He has had a very good time the last two
years; it’s <i>my</i> turn now. I must have you
all to myself, no rivals, small or large,
which is one reason why I don’t want to
settle down at home just at present. We
should have nothing but one scene of visiting,
feasting, and mutual entertainments.
Whereas, roaming about abroad, we can
scorn all social claims, spend our time
as we please, and, if the worst comes to
the worst, pretend we are bride and bridegroom.
If you are a good girl and get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
strong and well by Christmas I shall bring
you home again; if not, I shall take you
on to Egypt.”</p>

<p>“Egypt!” she echoed. “Why Egypt?
And why do you sigh, Regy, and look at
me so wistfully?” she asked, raising her
gray eyes to his fond dark ones, that
seemed to brim over with a look of
anguish she could not understand.</p>

<p>“I did not sigh,” he replied mendaciously.
“And why not go to Egypt?
You know you have always had a craving
to out-travel Helen and to see the old
Nile. Come, it is getting late, I cannot
let you stay out any longer; the dew is
falling, you must go in.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I see you have had enough of
me already,” she replied with a pretty
little shrug. “Tell me, Regy, who have
you got in this locket?—you never used
to wear one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>

<p>“Who do you think—are you jealous?
A Begum who took rather a fancy to me,”
he said, opening the case and revealing
herself. “As long as I had the original
I never wore it of course. I believe this
locket is a kind of talisman; it has been
twice into action, for I never left it out
of my possession night or day.”</p>

<p>They were slowly promenading up and
down the centre garden-walk, now stopping
for an instant, now again going on, this
time very, very leisurely, as it was the
very last turn they were to take. On
this point Reginald was resolute, although
he grudged sorely to shorten the happiest
hour he had known for years. Oblivious
of all the world, and absorbed in each
other, they were approaching the gate,
which suddenly burst open, and Geoffrey,
singing, “Alice, where art thou?” appeared.</p>

<p>“I’ve been sent,” he shouted, “to know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
if you mean to roost in the pear-tree?
<i>Where</i> are the pears?” he added imperiously.
“Why, what’s all this? I do
believe,” looking from one to the other,
“that you two have buried the hatchet,
come off the war-path, and smoked the
pipe of peace!”</p>

<p>“Yes, wise and observant Geoffrey, you
are right for once. We have been the
victims of an unfortunate accident that has
cost us both very dearly,” replied Reginald
gravely.</p>

<p>“Hip, hip, hurrah!” cried Geoffrey,
dancing a war-dance round them, concluding
with three wild bounds into the air.</p>

<p>“I really must embrace you, my dear
Regy. You know I’d twice as soon have
you as Alice.” So saying he flung himself
on Reginald <i>à la Française</i>.</p>

<p>“No no, my dear fellow, you really
must excuse me,” pushing him back. “If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
you must kiss somebody, you may kiss
Alice; and for your kind congratulations,
conveyed, I presume, by those wild evolutions
just now, receive my warmest
thanks. Also,” he added more seriously,
“for all your well-meant but unsuccessful
endeavours to reconcile us, all the <i>tête-à-tête</i>
rides and walks you contrived. Only you
are not an old woman, you would make
a superb chaperone.”</p>

<p>A less shrewd observer than Geoffrey
could see that this assumed gaiety covered
a deeper emotion Reginald could hardly
conceal.</p>

<p>“Well, here, Alice, is a kiss for you, by
your lord and master’s kind permission.”</p>

<p>“Imagine you have had it, it will do
as well,” cried Alice, waving him away
with both hands.</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Geoffrey, rather
huffed. “Imagination is no doubt better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
than reality in this particular instance.
I always knew if anyone could manage
you, or get you along at all in double
harness, it was our right honourable friend.
But you must confess you jibbed frightfully
at starting. Plenty of the whip,
that’s what you all want.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘A woman, a dog, and a walnut-tree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The more you beat them the better they be.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Isn’t that so?”</p>

<p>“Geoffrey!” exclaimed Alice, “have you
taken leave of your senses! If people were
to see you whooping and springing about
they would certainly think we kept a
private lunatic asylum, and that you were
one of our most dangerous patients. Do
be cautious, the moon is at the full!”</p>

<p>Reginald having started off to fetch the
pears, Geoffrey watched him out of sight,
and then said: “Alice, my good girl,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
seriously and soberly, I never was so glad
of anything in all my life. He is the best
fellow I ever knew, and ten times too good
for you.”</p>

<p>“No one knows that better than myself,”
she replied meekly, to Geoffrey’s unbounded
surprise.</p>

<p>“Good-night, Geoff; I’m going. Tell
him to tell them; I couldn’t,” she added,
vanishing through the gateway.</p>

<p>“Alice has gone, Rex,” said Geoffrey,
“and you are to break it gently to the
family. No one could eat pears now: leave
them on the garden-seat and come along.
You and Alice are the only <i>pair</i> they will
think of to-night.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes they had rejoined the
party in the pleasure-ground.</p>

<p>“Well, what has kept you? Have you
brought the pears?” inquired Helen, languidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>“No; but I have brought you a piece
of good news instead. You can guess what
it is, can you not?”</p>

<p>“I can, my dear Regy,” she replied,
rising hastily—her active mind having
grasped the truth in one second—and
kissing him with effusion. “I know there
is only one thing that could make you
look so happy. Where is Alice?”</p>

<p>“This,” said Geoffrey with mock gravity,
taking Reginald’s unwilling hand, “is
Petruchio. Katharina has retired. In plain
English, Alice was too bashful to return
here, and desired me to accept your congratulations
as her deputy. I’ve no doubt,
Helen, that you and Miss Ferrars will find
her in her room.”</p>

<p>Helen and Miss Ferrars were not long
in acting on this hint, and found Alice
sitting in the window-sill in the moonlight,
leisurely unplaiting her long, golden-brown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
plaits. She received them with smiles and
tears.</p>

<p>“I knew you would come,” she said,
throwing herself into Helen’s arms; “you
have always been our good genius. You
have heard it all from him, have you not?”
she whispered.</p>

<p>“Only a sketch—a mere outline,” Helen
replied, seating herself. “I have a vague
idea that you are going abroad, that I am
to have charge of Maurice, and that we are
all to meet at Looton at Christmas. The
moment I saw Regy’s face I knew what
had happened. Dear boy! it does one good
to see him looking like himself once more.”</p>

<p>The three ladies remained talking
together till the small hours, much to the
detriment of Alice and Mary’s roses, and
the tale of the lost letter was told and
re-told, deplored and discussed, at least ten
times over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>The next morning Reginald started for
Looton, and within a week Sir R. and
Lady Fairfax were among the fashionable
departures for the Continent, and the party
at Monkswood dispersed, to reunite at
Christmas.</p>

</div>


<p>It is the end of the first week in January—bleak,
black January! Outside Looton
the snow is falling lightly but persistently;
already it is a foot deep in the park. It
is a bitterly cold, dreary, dark evening.
Not a single living creature is abroad that
can possibly find shelter. What a night
for the homeless—what a night for the
miserable starving birds!</p>

<p>Inside Looton the prospect is much more
cheerful. A huge log fire is roaring up
the chimney of the great hall, lighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
up the frames of dingy-looking portraits,
reflecting itself in more than one dinted
steel cuirass and battered casque, and
generally illuminating the arms and armour
of many a dead and gone Fairfax.</p>

<p>A large mastiff lies luxuriously at full
length on a tiger-skin before the fire; but
of other living inmates the room is empty.
The letter-box stands on the table; no one
is looking—let us have a peep. Here is an
epistle from Mrs. Mayhew to Miss Saville,
which will doubtless tell us all the family
news.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“Looton, <i>Jan. 5th</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Saville</span>,</p>

<p>“I am quite ashamed of myself for
never having answered your kind New
Year’s letter. But you have <i>no</i> idea what
a whirl we have been living in since Christmas.
I never seem to have a moment to
myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>“Nearly all the party have gone out
skating to-day—an amusement not at all
in <i>my</i> line—so at last I have an hour
to devote to my many indignant correspondents.</p>

<p>“You have heard from Alice frequently,
of course, and I am sure she has told
you how much we have missed you, and
how disappointed she and Regy have been
at your absence. It is really too bad of
your old enemy, rheumatism, to seize on
you just at this time.</p>

<p>“We have had such a Christmas!
Reginald and Alice determined that, as it
was the <i>first</i> they had ever spent together,
they would celebrate the occasion properly.
There was a dinner to the tenantry, to
whom Maurice was duly presented in the
character of the heir. Theatricals and a
ball entertained the grandees; nor were
the poor forgotten—beef, coals, warm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
clothes, and money were lavishly bestowed
on every side. The master and mistress
of Looton are so happy themselves, they
do their very best to spread that rather
scarce commodity in all directions, and share
it with rich and poor, as far as money
and kind words and deeds can go.</p>

<p>“You will like to hear all about Alice
and Regy from a third party, especially
as I know how reticent Alice is about herself—her
letters are probably filled with
Maurice and Reginald, Reginald and
Maurice.</p>

<p>“Four months in Italy have worked
wonders for her. She has completely recovered
her blooming cheeks, her gay
spirits, and, above all, her health. She
still looks a mere girl in her teens, and as
little of the matron as ever. I have done
my best to put a stop to her hunting, but
it is of no use, especially as she has Regy’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
permission and countenance. He only
takes her when the distances are moderate
and the country to match, and as she is
always superbly mounted, and well looked
after and piloted by her husband, I don’t
think you need be nervous; and I must
say they both enjoy it so much, and look
so supremely happy when setting out
together on a hunting morning, that it
seems almost a pity to make any more
protests.</p>

<p>“Reginald is a changed man—no longer
silent, morose, and cynical; he is my own
dear light-hearted Regy once more, and
enters into everything with as much zest
and spirit as Geoff himself. A happier
couple than he and Alice could not be
found. It is a pleasure to see them
together. She runs a good chance of
being completely spoiled, only for her
sweet, unselfish disposition. She is allowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
her own way in everything. Fortunately
it is Reginald’s way too, so there is no
harm done. Their opinions, wishes, and
tastes seem to be identical. Some day or
other Alice’s individuality will be completely
lost and absorbed in Reginald’s
stronger mind and will. I tell him this
sometimes, and make him extremely angry.
I am keeping our great piece of news to
the last, as a <i>bonne bouche</i>. I am sure
you will be interested to know that Captain
Vaughan and Mary Ferrars are engaged.
He has been here since the first week in
December, and their happiness is now
of a whole week’s standing. They seem
to be very well suited and mutually in
love. He confided to me that it was the
extreme felicity of Reginald and Alice that
had encouraged him to follow <i>their example</i>.
This time last year who would have believed
that they would be the couple—of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
all others—to lure their friends into
matrimony? At times I feared a very
different conclusion. However, they fully
bear out the good old saying, ‘All’s well
that ends well.’</p>

Year, ever, dear Miss Saville,</p>

<h3>INCIDENTS OF A FOUR MONTHS’ VOYAGE ON THE NILE.</h3>

<h4>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</h4>

<p>“A lively and unpretentious piece of work, while being based upon journals
that were kept from day to day, it gives an extremely faithful picture of a
dahabeeah voyage. Too often the Nile notes of romantic travellers seem to be
steeped in the sensuous memories of the Sybarite or lotus-eater, and are rather
drawn on conventional impressions of things, as they are supposed to be, than
the reflection of facts or exact recollections. Mr. Arnold thoroughly enjoyed
the journey; but he shows, at the same time, that everything was not always
<i>couleur de rose</i>.... In the way of sensational excitement, indeed, Mr. Arnold
had one adventure such as seldom, happily, falls to the lot of the Nile voyager.
His dahabeeah was actually shipwrecked—not in shooting the perilous rapids
of the cataracts, but on one of the lower stretches of the river; and so his
pleasant family party was broken up.”—<i>The Times.</i></p>

<p>“He recalls very pleasantly the various incidents of that daily Nile life of
which every traveller’s reminiscences are so delightful. One exceptional experience,
indeed, he met with. His dahabieh was wrecked, and the family party
broken up, he alone being enabled, by the generous and characteristic hospitality
of an American traveller, to continue the voyage.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>“A pleasantly and picturesquely, but very ambitiously, written account of a
trip up the Nile. The author is the son of one of the most splendidly rhetorical
of living journalists, and he bids fair to inherit the characteristic gifts of his
eloquent sire.”—<i>World.</i></p>

<p>“It may be that there is little new in this bright and gallant volume of
travel; but the young writer can fairly be congratulated on his power of presenting,
in fresh and vigorous colours, so much that is old. He has written, in
truth, a volume by no means deficient in the quality which should be understood
in the full sense of the term—‘information;’ and his command of easy,
graceful, and natural language shows the literary faculty that might be
expected in him.”—<i>Daily Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>“The charm of this diary consists in its faithful account of the life and experiences
of an English party travelling in Egypt. A very exciting and alarming
adventure befel them almost at the commencement, the vessel in which
they were travelling being wrecked. The story of the disaster, and the narrow
escape of the two ladies and two gentlemen, is vividly told.”—<i>Daily Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>“Messrs. Tinsley have seldom brought out a more attractive work than this
voyage upon the Nile.... The series of pictures furnished by Mr. Arnold’s
graphic description of the various scenes he visited remain fixed on the mind’s
eye of the reader long after the book is closed.”—<i>Court Journal.</i></p>

<p>“‘The book,’ says Mr. Arnold in his preface, ‘does not aspire to take the
place of any learned treatise or methodical guide, but simply to catch the joyous
spirit of the rich sunlight of the river, and to reproduce its scenes and sights by
easy and passing touches.’ This aim it attains with very considerable success....
Really a delightful book.”—<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p>“We cannot but congratulate Mr. Arnold on his success as a clever and
effective narrator. Seldom have we read a more enjoyable book of travels than
‘Palms and Temples.’”—<i>Literary World.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Arnold’s book is distinctly new, novel, and interesting.”—<i>Land and
Water.</i></p>
